Transmission of 2019-nCoV Infection
from an Asymptomatic Contact in Germany
To the Editor: The novel coronavirus (2019nCoV) from Wuhan is currently causing concern
in the medical community as the virus is spreading around the world.1 Since identification of the
virus in late December 2019, the number of cases
from China that have been imported into other
countries is on the rise, and the epidemiologic
picture is changing on a daily basis. We are reporting a case of 2019-nCoV infection acquired
outside Asia in which transmission appears to
have occurred during the incubation period in
the index patient.
A 33-year-old otherwise healthy German businessman (Patient 1) became ill with a sore throat,
chills, and myalgias on January 24, 2020. The
following day, a fever of 39.1°C (102.4°F) developed, along with a productive cough. By the
evening of the next day, he started feeling better
and went back to work on January 27.
Before the onset of symptoms, he had attended
meetings with a Chinese business partner at his
company near Munich on January 20 and 21.
The business partner, a Shanghai resident, had
visited Germany between January 19 and 22.
During her stay, she had been well with no signs
or symptoms of infection but had become ill on
her flight back to China, where she tested posithis week's letters

tive for 2019-nCoV on January 26 (index patient
in Fig. 1) (see Supplementary Appendix, available
at NEJM.org, for details on the timeline of symptom development leading to hospitalization).
On January 27, she informed the company
about her illness. Contact tracing was started,
and the above-mentioned colleague was sent to
the Division of Infectious Diseases and Tropical
Medicine in Munich for further assessment. At
presentation, he was afebrile and well. He reported no previous or chronic illnesses and had
no history of foreign travel within 14 days before
the onset of symptoms. Two nasopharyngeal
swabs and one sputum sample were obtained
and were found to be positive for 2019-nCoV on
quantitative reverse-transcriptase–polymerasechain-reaction (qRT-PCR) assay.2 Follow-up qRTPCR assay revealed a high viral load of 108 copies
per milliliter in his sputum during the following
days, with the last available result on January 29.
On January 28, three additional employees at
the company tested positive for 2019-nCoV (Patients 2 through 4 in Fig. 1). Of these patients,
only Patient 2 had contact with the index patient;
the other two patients had contact only with
Patient 1. In accordance with the health authorities, all the patients with confirmed 2019nCoV infection were admitted to a Munich infectious diseases unit for clinical monitoring and
isolation. So far, none of the four confirmed
patients show signs of severe clinical illness.
This case of 2019-nCoV infection was diagnosed in Germany and transmitted outside Asia.
However, it is notable that the infection appears
to have been transmitted during the incubation
period of the index patient, in whom the illness
was brief and nonspecific.3
The fact that asymptomatic persons are potential sources of 2019-nCoV infection may war-

rant a reassessment of transmission dynamics of
the current outbreak. In this context, the detection of 2019-nCoV and a high sputum viral load
in a convalescent patient (Patient 1) arouse concern about prolonged shedding of 2019-nCoV
after recovery. Yet, the viability of 2019-nCoV
detected on qRT-PCR in this patient remains to
be proved by means of viral culture.
Despite these concerns, all four patients who
were seen in Munich have had mild cases and
were hospitalized primarily for public health
purposes. Since hospital capacities are limited
— in particular, given the concurrent peak of
the influenza season in the northern hemisphere — research is needed to determine
whether such patients can be treated with appropriate guidance and oversight outside the
hospital.
