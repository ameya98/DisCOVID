One sentence summary
Travel restrictions and the national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of
the COVID-19 epidemic in China.
Abstract
Respiratory illness caused by a novel coronavirus (COVID-19) appeared in China during
December 2019. Attempting to contain infection, China banned travel to and from Wuhan city on
23 January and implemented a national emergency response. Here we evaluate the spread and
control of the epidemic based on a unique synthesis of data including case reports, human
movement and public health interventions. The Wuhan shutdown slowed the dispersal of infection
to other cities by an estimated 2.91 days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29), delaying epidemic growth elsewhere
in China. Other cities that implemented control measures pre-emptively reported 33.3%
(11.1-44.4%) fewer cases in the first week of their outbreaks (13.0; 7.1-18.8) compared with cities
that started control later (20.6; 14.5-26.8). Among interventions investigated here, the most
effective were suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and banning
public gatherings. The national emergency response delayed the growth and limited the size of the
COVID-19 epidemic and, by 19 February (day 50), had averted hundreds of thousands of cases
across China.

Main text
On 31 December 2019, less than a month before the 2020 Spring Festival holiday, including the
Chinese Lunar New Year, a cluster of pneumonia cases caused by an unknown pathogen was
reported in Wuhan, a city of 11 million inhabitants and the largest transport hub in Central China.
A novel coronavirus (1, 2) was identified as the etiological agent (3, 4) and human-to-human
transmission of the viral disease (COVID-19) has been since confirmed (5, 6). Further spatial
spread of this disease was of great concern in view of the upcoming Spring Festival (“chunyun”)
during which there are typically three billion travel movements over the 40-day holiday period,
which runs from 15 days before the Spring Festival (Chinese Lunar New Year) to 25 days
afterwards (7).
As there is currently neither a vaccine nor a specific drug treatment for COVID-19, a range of
public health (non-pharmaceutical) interventions has been used to control the outbreak. In an
attempt to prevent further dispersal of COVID-19 from its source, all transport was prohibited in
and out of Wuhan city from 10:00h on 23 January 2020, followed by the whole of Hubei Province
a day later. In terms of the population covered, this appears to be the largest attempted quarantine
(movement restriction) event in human history.
On 23 January, China also raised its national public health response to the highest state of
emergency ─ Level 1 of 4 levels of severity in the Chinese Emergency System, defined as an
“extremely serious incident” (8). As part of the national emergency response, and in addition to
the Wuhan city travel ban, suspected and confirmed cases have been isolated, public transport by
bus and subway rail suspended, schools and entertainment venues have been closed, public
gatherings banned, health checks carried out on migrants (“floating population”), travel prohibited
in and out of cities, and information widely disseminated. Despite all these measures, the outbreak
has continued to spread geographically, within and beyond China, with mounting numbers of
cases and deaths.
Although the spatial spread of infectious diseases has been intensively studied (9-14), including
explicit studies of the role of human movement (15, 16), the effectiveness of travel restrictions and
social distancing measures in preventing the spread of infection is uncertain. For COVID-19,
coronavirus transmission patterns and the impact of interventions are still poorly understood (6, 7).
We therefore carried out a quantitative analysis of the impact of travel restrictions and
transmission control measures during the first 50 days of the COVID-19 epidemic in China, from
31 December 2019 to 19 February 2020 (Fig. 1). This period embraced the 40 days of the Spring
Festival holiday, 15 days before the Chinese Lunar New Year on 25 January and 25 days
afterwards. The analysis is based on a unique geocoded repository of data on COVID-19
epidemiology, human movement, and public health (non-pharmaceutical) interventions.
We first investigated the effect of the Wuhan city travel ban, comparing travel in 2020 with that in
previous years and exploring the consequences of holiday travel for the dispersal of infection
across China. During Spring Festival travel in 2017 and 2018, there was an average outflow of 5.2
million people from Wuhan city during the 15 days before the Chinese Lunar New Year. In 2020,
this travel was interrupted by the Wuhan city shutdown, but 4.3 million people travelled out of the

city between 11 January and the implementation of the ban on 23 January (7) (Fig. 2A). In 2017
and 2018, travel out of the city during the 25 days after the Chinese Lunar New Year averaged 6.7
million people each year. In 2020, the travel ban prevented almost all of that movement.
The dispersal of COVID-19 from Wuhan was rapid (Fig. 3A). A total of 262 cities reported cases
within 28 days. For comparison, the 2009 influenza H1N1pdm pandemic took 132 days to reach
the same number of cities in China. The number of cities providing first reports of COVID-19
peaked at 59 per day on 23 January, the date of the Wuhan travel ban.
The total number of cases reported from each province by 30 January, one week after the Wuhan
shutdown, was strongly associated with the total number of travellers from Wuhan (r=0.98,
P<0.01; excluding Hubei, r=0.69, P<0.01; Figs. 2B and 2C). COVID-19 arrived sooner in those
cities that had larger populations and had more travellers from Wuhan (Tables 1 and S1). However,
the Wuhan travel ban delayed the arrival time of COVID-19 in other cities by an estimated 2.91
days (95%CI: 2.54-3.29 days) on average (Table 1, Fig. 3B). More than 130 cities, covering more
than half the geographic area and population of China, benefited from the delay.
This delay provided extra time to prepare for the arrival of COVID-19 across China but would not
have curbed transmission after infection had been exported to new locations from Wuhan. Fig. 1
shows the timing and implementation of emergency control measures in 342 cities across China
(see also Figs. S2 and S4). School closure, the isolation of suspected and confirmed patients, plus
the disclosure of information was implemented in all cities. Public gatherings were banned and
entertainment venues closed in 220 cities (64.3%). Intra-city public transport was suspended in
136 cities (39.7%) and inter-city travel was prohibited by 219 cities (64.0%). All three measures
were applied in 136 cities (Table S2).
Cities that implemented a Level 1 response (any combination of control measures; Figs. S2 and S4)
pre-emptively, before discovering any COVID-19 cases, reported 33.3% (95%CI: 11.1-44.4%)
fewer laboratory-confirmed cases during the first week of an outbreak (13.0, 95%CI: 7.1-18.8,
n=125) compared with cities that started control later (20.6 cases, 95%CI: 14.5-26.8, n=171;
difference between groups, U=8197 z=-3.4, P<0.01). Among specific control measures, cities that
suspended intra-city public transport and/or closed entertainment venues and banned public
gatherings, and did so sooner, reported fewer cases during the first week of their outbreaks (Table
2, Table S3). This analysis provided no evidence that the prohibition of travel between cities,
which was implemented after and in addition to the Wuhan shutdown on 23 January, reduced the
number of cases in other cities across China. These results are robust to the choice of statistical
regression model (Supplementary Material, Table S3).
The reported daily incidence of confirmed cases peaked in Hubei province (including Wuhan) on
4 February (3156 laboratory-confirmed cases, 5.33/100,000 population in Hubei), and in all other
provinces on 31 January (875 cases, 0.07/100,000 population; Fig. S1). The low level of peak
incidence per capita, the early timing of the peak, and the subsequent decline in daily case reports,
suggest that transmission control measures not only delayed the growth of the epidemic, but also
greatly limited the number of cases. By fitting an epidemic model to the time series of cases

reported in each province (Supplementary Material, Fig. S3), we estimate that the (basic) case
reproduction number (R0) was 3.15 prior to the implementation of the emergency response on 23
January (Table 3). As control was scaled-up from 23 January onwards (stage 1), the case
reproduction number declined to 0.97, 2.01 and 3.05 (estimated as C1R0) in three groups of
provinces, depending on the rate of implementation in each group (Tables 3 and S4). Once the
implementation of interventions was 95% complete everywhere (stage 2), the case reproduction
number had fallen to 0.04 on average (C2R0), far below the replacement rate (<< 1) and consistent
with the rapid decline in incidence (Fig. 4A, Fig. S5, Table 3, Table S4).
Based on the fit of the model to daily case reports from each province, we investigated the
aggregate effect of control measures on the trajectory of the epidemic outside Wuhan city (Fig.
4B). Without the Wuhan travel ban or the national emergency response, there would have been
744,000 (± 156,000) confirmed COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan by 19 February, day 50 of the
epidemic. The Wuhan travel ban alone would have reduced this number to 202,000 (± 10,000)
cases, by delaying epidemic growth. The national emergency response alone would have cut the
number of cases to 199,000 (± 8500). Therefore neither of these interventions would, on their own,
have reversed the rise in incidence by 19 February (Fig. 4B). But together and interactively, these
control measures evidently did halt and reverse the rise in incidence, limiting the number of
confirmed cases reported to 29,839 (fitted model estimate 28,000 ± 1400 cases), a 96% reduction
on the total number of cases expected in the absence of interventions.
In summary, this early analysis suggests that transmission control (non-pharmaceutical) measures
initiated during Chinese Spring Festival holiday, including the unprecedented Wuhan city travel
ban and the Level 1 national emergency response, delayed the growth and limited the size of the
COVID-19 epidemic in China. Urbanization and the development of rapid transport systems in
China (17-20) probably accelerated the spread and magnified the challenge of controlling
COVID-19, as indicated by the comparatively slow dispersal of pandemic influenza H1N1pdm in
2009. In addition, the COVID-19 epidemic began just before the period of intense travel during
the Spring Festival holiday. Nevertheless, the Wuhan city travel ban provided extra time to
implement transmission control measures in other parts of China and, once established, these were
an additional powerful force in curtailing and reversing the epidemic.
The number of people who have developed COVID-19 during this epidemic, and therefore the
number of people who were protected by control measures, is not known precisely, given that
cases were almost certainly under-reported. However, in view of the small fraction of people
known to have been infected by 19 February (75,532 cases, 5.41 per 100,000 population), it is
unlikely that the spread of infection was halted and epidemic growth reversed because the supply
of susceptible people had been exhausted. This implies that a large fraction of the Chinese
population remains at risk of COVID-19; relaxing control measures could lead to a resurgence of
transmission. Further investigations are needed to verify that proposition, and population surveys
of infection are needed to reveal the true number of people who have been exposed to this novel
coronavirus.
We could not investigate the impact of all elements of the national emergency response because

many were introduced simultaneously across China. However, there is firm evidence from the data
used in this analysis that suspending intra-city public transport, closing entertainment venues and
banning public gatherings, which were introduced at different times in different places,
contributed to the overall containment of the epidemic. Other factors are likely to have contributed
to control, such as the isolation of suspected and confirmed patients, contact tracing and the
closure of schools, and it is not yet clear which parts of the national emergency response were
most effective. We did not find that prohibiting travel between cities or provinces reduced the
numbers of COVID-19 cases outside Wuhan and Hubei, perhaps because such travel bans were
implemented as a response to, rather than in anticipation of, the arrival of COVID-19.
This study has drawn inferences, not from a controlled experiment, but from statistical and
mathematical analyses of the temporal and spatial variation in case reports, human mobility and
transmission control measures. With that caveat, we conclude that these control measures had a
major impact on the COVID-19 epidemic, averting hundreds of thousands of cases by 19 Feburary.
Whether the means and the outcomes of control can be replicated outside China, and which of the
interventions are most effective, are now under intense investigation as the virus continues to
spread worldwide.

Materials and Methods
Data sources
Epidemiological, demographic and geographical data
We collected data from the official reports of the health commission of 34 provincial-level
administrative units and 342 city-level units. We recorded the date of the first reported case in all
newly-infected cities, including daily reports from 31 December 2019 to 19 February 2020, the
first 50 days of the epidemic. Only laboratory-confirmed cases of COVID-19 were used.
Population sizes for each city in 2018 were obtained from the China City Statistical Yearbook
(http://olap.epsnet.com.cn/). Using ArcGIS we calculated the great circle distance between Wuhan
and each city reporting COVID-19 cases. The location of each city is geocoded by the latitude and
longitude coordinates of the city centre. For the 2009 H1N1 Pandemic (2009-H1N1pdm), daily
case data were collected from China Information System for Disease Control and Prevention
(CISDCP) from 10 May 2009 to 30 April 2010, a total of more than 180,000 cases (5).
Human mobility data
Human movements were tracked with mobile phone data, through location-based services (LBS)
employed by popular Tencent applications such as WeChat and QQ. Movement outflows from
Wuhan City to other cities (i.e. records of the number of people leaving each day) by air, train and
road, were obtained from the migration flows database (https://heat.qq.com/) (21) from 13 January
2017 to 21 February 2017 (Spring Festival travel 2017), from 1 February 2018 to 12 March 2018
(Spring Festival travel 2018), and from 1 January 2018 to 31 December 2018 (entire 2018). To
reconstruct the movement outflow from Wuhan during the 2020 Spring Festival (from 11 January
to 25 January, before the Chinese Lunar New Year), mobile phone data (provided by the
telecommunications operators) were used together with the Baidu migration index
(http://qianxi.baidu.com/); using both data sources gave the most accurate measure of movement
volume. The expected movement outflows from Wuhan after the New Year festival from 26
January to 19 February, had there been no travel ban, were generated by using travel volumes for
2017 and 2018 and the recorded travel destinations prior to the shutdown in 2020. We assumed
that the proportion of daily outflows from Wuhan to each of the other destinations in China was
constant through time.
Data analysis
Effect of the Wuhan city travel ban on the arrival time of COVID-19 in other cities
In order to quantify the effect of the Wuhan travel shutdown (23 January 2020) on COVID-19
spread, we used data collected between 31 December 2019 and 28 January 2020. The association
between distance, human movement, interventions and timing of COVID-19 spread was assessed
by regression with a general linear model (GLM). Among five possible regression models
examined (Table S3), the model judged best by the Akaike Information Criterion) was:

465

Y j    1 log10 TotalFlow j    2 log10  Pop j   3 Lon j  4 Lat j   5 Shutdown j

466
467
468

Dependent variable Yj is the arrival time (day) of the first confirmed case in city j, a measure of the
spatial spread of COVID-19. The βi are the regression coefficients. α is the intercept. TotalFlowj

represents the passenger volume from Wuhan to city j by airplane, train and road during the whole
of 2018. Popj is the population of city j. Latj and Lon j represent the latitude and longitude of city j.
The binary dummy variable Shutdownj is used to identify whether the arrival time of COVID-19
in newly-infected city j is influenced by the Wuhan travel ban. For each city, shutdown was set to
0 for arrival before 23 January 2020 and 1 for arrival on or after 23 January 2020. The regression
analysis was performed using the R package (R version 3.4.0) MASS (22). All of the candidate
models examined (Table S3) produced similar estimates for the estimated delay in the arrival time
due to the shutdown.

Effect of transmission control measures on the number of cases reported during the first week of
an outbreak in a new location
The Level 1 national emergency response required suspected and confirmed cases of COVID-19
to be isolated and reported immediately in all cities. Using data for 342 cities across China, we
investigated the effects of three transmission control measures: closure of entertainment venues
and banning public gatherings (B); suspension of intra-city public transport (S); and prohibition of
travel by any means to and from other cities (P). The timing of implementation was recorded for
each control measure in each city, including the delay in implementation since 31 December 2019
(day 0 of the epidemic). Each city was regarded as implementing an intervention when the official
policy was announced publicly (Table S1). Other transmission control measures included
delineating control areas, closure of schools, isolation of suspected and confirmed cases, and the
disclosure of information. The effects of these interventions could not be investigated because
they were reportedly applied in all cities uniformly and without delay.
As above, we used regression analysis to investigate the effects of interventions B, S and P. The
dependent (Poisson) variable is the total number of confirmed cases that were reported during the
first seven days (μ) of an outbreak in any city (i). The analysis was performed using the GLM
function in the statistical software R (version 3.6.2) using the model:

where population size of a city i (Oi) and inflow from Wuhan (Fi) are offset variables, while the
distance to Wuhan and the arrival time of the infection are adjustments to control for confounding
with other independent variables. The βj’s are regression coefficients. Mi,k is a binary variable
indicating whether or not control measure k is implemented in city i. Ti,k represents the timing of
implementation of control measure k in city i. Di is the distance from city i to Wuhan City. Ai is the
arrival time of the epidemic in city i (the date of the first confirmed case).
To check and confirm the validity of results obtained with the Poisson regression model, we
repeated the analysis with a log-linear model. The first step was to standardize case counts by
dividing by the number of people in each city (incidence per capita) and the number of people

515

The subscripts of the coefficients (j) are consistent with a Poisson regression model. To avoid
heteroscedasticity, variables describing the distance from Wuhan, and the implementation and
timing of P (prohibiting inter-city travel) were removed. Further exploration of the model showed

516

that these variables did not help to explain variation in . Table S3 presents the results of the
log-linear regression analysis, which uphold the conclusions reached from the Poisson regression
model.
Epidemic modelling
For each province, we estimated the effect of transmission control measures by fitting an SEIR
model (23) to the number of new confirmed cases reported each day from each province using
Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods (24). The model is:

where S, E, I, and R are the number of susceptible, exposed (latent), infectious, and removed
individuals on day t in province i. This standard SEIR model makes some simplifying assumptions:
for example, the human population is homogeneous (e.g. not stratified by age or sex), contacts
between infectious and susceptible people are also homogeneous (e.g. not stratified by social
group) and infection is fully immunizing (1). However, the model describes the data accurately
(Fig. 4A, Fig. S3) and these assumptions are unlikely to affect the principal conclusions of the
analysis, which apply only to the first 50 days of the epidemic. The basic reproductive number of
the model is R0 =β/γ, where β is the per capita transmission rate per day and 1/δ and 1/γ are,
respectively, the mean latent and infectious periods.
Variable λ is the estimated number of cases imported from Wuhan City on day t:

mobility 15 days before the Chinese Lunar New Year 2020. The binary variable shutdown is used
to identify whether cases were or were not exported from Wuhan on or after 23 January 2020.
The effects of control measures at different stages of the outbreak are captured by estimated
parameter C (range 0-1), which reduces transmission and R0 proportionally as a multiplicand of β.
The timing and implementation of transmission control measures in the 342 cities and 31
provinces are shown in Fig. S4. Before 22 January 2020, there were no recorded interventions thus
C0=1. From 23 January onwards, provinces gradually scaled up Level 1 emergency responses
(stage 1), with effects measured as C1 (Fig. S4). Because the effects of control measures varied
among provinces during the scale-up, C1 was grouped into high C1_high, medium C1_medium, and low
C1_low. The allocation of provinces to groups was made by proposing several alternative
hypotheses and testing each by model fitting (Table 3, Table S4). Stage 2 of control (C2) began
when more than 95% of cities in a province had implemented control measures, including the
closure of entertainment venues, suspension of intra-city public transport or prohibition of travel
by any means to and from other cities (see above). In Hubei Province (except Wuhan city), stage 2
included the use of shelter or “Fang Cang” hospitals from early February onwards.
Model fitting was performed using the Metropolis–Hastings Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC)
algorithm with the MATLAB (version R2016b) toolbox DRAM (Delayed Rejection Adaptive
Metropolis). Prior estimates of the mean and (Gaussian) variance of R0, δ, and γ were derived from
epidemiological surveys (25). There was no evidence to inform a prior for the reporting rate ρ, the
proportion of cases that were reported among all latent and infectious individuals in Wuhan.
Systematic surveys of infection (e.g. by serological testing) have not yet been reported. In the
absence of any guiding data, ρ was given a prior uniform distribution between 0 and 1.
After a burn-in of 1 million iterations, we ran the MCMC simulation for a further 10 million
iterations, sampled at every 1000th step to avoid auto-correlation. Trace plots and Gelman and
Rubin diagnostics were used to judge convergence of the MCMC chains (Fig. S4). Each fitting
exercise was repeated three times to test the robustness of results, which converged to the same
estimates on each occasion (Fig. S5). We used the fitted SEIR model, with posterior estimates of
parameter values, to simulate outbreaks outside Wuhan, with and without the Wuhan travel ban
and with and without the national emergency response (Fig. 4B).

time and geographical distance. (A) Daily reports of confirmed cases from each of 31 provinces.
Provinces are ranked by decreasing volume of people leaving Wuhan for other destinations, to
elsewhere in Hubei Province (top) and to Tibet (bottom). (B) Synchrony of epidemics in different
provinces in relation to distance between provinces. Synchrony is measured by the correlation
between the number of cases reported in two provinces on each day, using a spatial
non-parametric correlation function (26).
