Sum m a r y
An outbreak of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV) that began in Wuhan, China, has
spread rapidly, with cases now confirmed in multiple countries. We report the first
case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the United States and describe the identification, diagnosis, clinical course, and management of the case, including the
patient’s initial mild symptoms at presentation with progression to pneumonia on
day 9 of illness. This case highlights the importance of close coordination between
clinicians and public health authorities at the local, state, and federal levels, as
well as the need for rapid dissemination of clinical information related to the care
of patients with this emerging infection.

O

n December 31, 2019, China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people associated with the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in
Wuhan, Hubei Province.1 On January 7, 2020, Chinese health authorities
confirmed that this cluster was associated with a novel coronavirus, 2019-nCoV.2
Although cases were originally reported to be associated with exposure to the seafood market in Wuhan, current epidemiologic data indicate that person-to-person
transmission of 2019-nCoV is occurring.3-6 As of January 30, 2020, a total of 9976
cases had been reported in at least 21 countries,7 including the first confirmed
case of 2019-nCoV infection in the United States, reported on January 20, 2020.
Investigations are under way worldwide to better understand transmission dynamics and the spectrum of clinical illness. This report describes the epidemiologic
and clinical features of the first case of 2019-nCoV infection confirmed in the
United States.

On January 19, 2020, a 35-year-old man presented to an urgent care clinic in Snohomish County, Washington, with a 4-day history of cough and subjective fever. On checking into the clinic, the patient put on a mask in the waiting room. After waiting
approximately 20 minutes, he was taken into an examination room and underwent
evaluation by a provider. He disclosed that he had returned to Washington State
on January 15 after traveling to visit family in Wuhan, China. The patient stated

that he had seen a health alert from the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC)
about the novel coronavirus outbreak in China and,
because of his symptoms and recent travel, decided
to see a health care provider.
Apart from a history of hypertriglyceridemia,
the patient was an otherwise healthy nonsmoker.
The physical examination revealed a body temperature of 37.2°C, blood pressure of 134/87 mm Hg,
pulse of 110 beats per minute, respiratory rate of
16 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation of
96% while the patient was breathing ambient air.
Lung auscultation revealed rhonchi, and chest
radiography was performed, which was reported
as showing no abnormalities (Fig. 1). A rapid
nucleic acid amplification test (NAAT) for influenza A and B was negative. A nasopharyngeal
swab specimen was obtained and sent for detection of viral respiratory pathogens by NAAT; this
was reported back within 48 hours as negative
for all pathogens tested, including influenza A
and B, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus,
rhinovirus, adenovirus, and four common coronavirus strains known to cause illness in humans
(HKU1, NL63, 229E, and OC43).
Given the patient’s travel history, the local and
state health departments were immediately notified. Together with the urgent care clinician,
the Washington Department of Health notified the CDC Emergency Operations Center. Although the patient reported that he had not
spent time at the Huanan seafood market and
reported no known contact with ill persons dur930

ing his travel to China, CDC staff concurred with
the need to test the patient for 2019-nCoV on the
basis of current CDC “persons under investigation”
case definitions.8 Specimens were collected in
accordance with CDC guidance and included serum and nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swab
specimens. After specimen collection, the patient
was discharged to home isolation with active
monitoring by the local health department.
On January 20, 2020, the CDC confirmed that
the patient’s nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
swabs tested positive for 2019-nCoV by real-time
reverse-transcriptase–polymerase-chain-reaction
(rRT-PCR) assay. In coordination with CDC subject-matter experts, state and local health officials, emergency medical services, and hospital
leadership and staff, the patient was admitted to
an airborne-isolation unit at Providence Regional Medical Center for clinical observation, with
health care workers following CDC recommendations for contact, droplet, and airborne precautions with eye protection.9
On admission, the patient reported persistent
dry cough and a 2-day history of nausea and vomiting; he reported that he had no shortness of
breath or chest pain. Vital signs were within normal ranges. On physical examination, the patient
was found to have dry mucous membranes. The
remainder of the examination was generally unremarkable. After admission, the patient received
supportive care, including 2 liters of normal saline and ondansetron for nausea.

6 through 9 of illness), the patient’s vital signs
remained largely stable, apart from the development of intermittent fevers accompanied by periods of tachycardia (Fig. 2). The patient continued to report a nonproductive cough and appeared
fatigued. On the afternoon of hospital day 2, the
patient passed a loose bowel movement and reported abdominal discomfort. A second episode
of loose stool was reported overnight; a sample
of this stool was collected for rRT-PCR testing,
along with additional respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal) and serum. The
stool and both respiratory specimens later tested
positive by rRT-PCR for 2019-nCoV, whereas the
serum remained negative.
Treatment during this time was largely supportive. For symptom management, the patient
received, as needed, antipyretic therapy consisting
of 650 mg of acetaminophen every 4 hours and
600 mg of ibuprofen every 6 hours. He also received 600 mg of guaifenesin for his continued
cough and approximately 6 liters of normal saline over the first 6 days of hospitalization.
The nature of the patient isolation unit permitted only point-of-care laboratory testing initially; complete blood counts and serum chemical studies were available starting on hospital
day 3. Laboratory results on hospital days 3 and 5
n engl j med 382;10

(illness days 7 and 9) reflected leukopenia, mild
thrombocytopenia, and elevated levels of creatine
kinase (Table 1). In addition, there were alterations
in hepatic function measures: levels of alkaline
phosphatase (68 U per liter), alanine aminotransferase (105 U per liter), aspartate aminotransferase
(77 U per liter), and lactate dehydrogenase (465 U
per liter) were all elevated on day 5 of hospitalization. Given the patient’s recurrent fevers, blood
cultures were obtained on day 4; these have
shown no growth to date.
A chest radiograph taken on hospital day 3
(illness day 7) was reported as showing no evidence of infiltrates or abnormalities (Fig. 3). However, a second chest radiograph from the night of
hospital day 5 (illness day 9) showed evidence of
pneumonia in the lower lobe of the left lung
(Fig. 4). These radiographic findings coincided
with a change in respiratory status starting on
the evening of hospital day 5, when the patient’s
oxygen saturation values as measured by pulse
oximetry dropped to as low as 90% while he was
breathing ambient air. On day 6, the patient was
started on supplemental oxygen, delivered by nasal cannula at 2 liters per minute. Given the
changing clinical presentation and concern about
hospital-acquired pneumonia, treatment with
vancomycin (a 1750-mg loading dose followed

On hospital day 6 (illness day 10), a fourth
chest radiograph showed basilar streaky opacities
in both lungs, a finding consistent with atypical
pneumonia (Fig. 5), and rales were noted in both
lungs on auscultation. Given the radiographic
findings, the decision to administer oxygen supplementation, the patient’s ongoing fevers, the
persistent positive 2019-nCoV RNA at multiple
sites, and published reports of the development
of severe pneumonia3,4 at a period consistent with
the development of radiographic pneumonia in
this patient, clinicians pursued compassionate
use of an investigational antiviral therapy. Treatment with intravenous remdesivir (a novel nucleotide analogue prodrug in development10,11) was
initiated on the evening of day 7, and no adverse
events were observed in association with the
infusion. Vancomycin was discontinued on the
evening of day 7, and cefepime was discontinued
on the following day, after serial negative procalcitonin levels and negative nasal PCR testing
for methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus.
On hospital day 8 (illness day 12), the patient’s
clinical condition improved. Supplemental oxygen was discontinued, and his oxygen saturation

Specimen Collection

Clinical specimens for 2019-nCoV diagnostic
testing were obtained in accordance with CDC
guidelines.12 Nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
swab specimens were collected with synthetic
fiber swabs; each swab was inserted into a separate sterile tube containing 2 to 3 ml of viral
transport medium. Serum was collected in a
serum separator tube and then centrifuged in
accordance with CDC guidelines. The urine and
stool specimens were each collected in sterile
specimen containers. Specimens were stored
between 2°C and 8°C until ready for shipment to
the CDC. Specimens for repeat 2019-nCoV testing were collected on illness days 7, 11, and 12
and included nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
swabs, serum, and urine and stool samples.

Genetic Sequencing

On January 7, 2020, Chinese researchers shared
the full genetic sequence of 2019-nCoV through
the National Institutes of Health GenBank database16 and the Global Initiative on Sharing All
Influenza Data (GISAID)17 database; a report about
the isolation of 2019-nCoV was later published.18
Nucleic acid was extracted from rRT-PCR–positive
specimens (oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal)
and used for whole-genome sequencing on both
Sanger and next-generation sequencing platforms (Illumina and MinIon). Sequence assembly was completed with the use of Sequencher
software, version 5.4.6 (Sanger); minimap software, version 2.17 (MinIon); and freebayes software, version 1.3.1 (MiSeq). Complete genomes
were compared with the available 2019-nCoV
reference sequence (GenBank accession number
NC_045512.2).

Diagnostic Testing for 2019-nCoV

Clinical specimens were tested with an rRT-PCR
assay that was developed from the publicly released
virus sequence. Similar to previous diagnostic assays for severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), it has three
nucleocapsid gene targets and a positive control
target. A description of this assay13 and sequence
information for the rRT-PCR panel primers and
probes14 are available on the CDC Laboratory
Information website for 2019-nCoV.15

Specimen Testing for 2019-nCoV

The initial respiratory specimens (nasopharyngeal
and oropharyngeal swabs) obtained from this
patient on day 4 of his illness were positive for
2019-nCoV (Table 2). The low cycle threshold
(Ct) values (18 to 20 in nasopharyngeal specimens and 21 to 22 in oropharyngeal specimens)
on illness day 4 suggest high levels of virus in
these specimens, despite the patient’s initial mild
symptom presentation. Both upper respiratory

specimens obtained on illness day 7 remained
positive for 2019-nCoV, including persistent high
levels in a nasopharyngeal swab specimen (Ct values, 23 to 24). Stool obtained on illness day 7
was also positive for 2019-nCoV (Ct values, 36 to
38). Serum specimens for both collection dates
were negative for 2019-nCoV. Nasopharyngeal
and oropharyngeal specimens obtained on illness days 11 and 12 showed a trend toward decreasing levels of virus. The oropharyngeal specimen tested negative for 2019-nCoV on illness
day 12. The rRT-PCR results for serum obtained
on these dates are still pending.
Genetic Sequencing

The full genome sequences from oropharyngeal
and nasopharyngeal specimens were identical to
one another and were nearly identical to other
available 2019-nCoV sequences. There were only
3 nucleotides and 1 amino acid that differed at
open reading frame 8 between this patient’s
virus and the 2019-nCoV reference sequence
(NC_045512.2). The sequence is available through
GenBank (accession number MN985325).16
Discussion

Our report of the first confirmed case of 2019nCoV in the United States illustrates several aspects of this emerging outbreak that are not yet
fully understood, including transmission dynamics and the full spectrum of clinical illness. Our
case patient had traveled to Wuhan, China, but
reported that he had not visited the wholesale
seafood market or health care facilities or had
any sick contacts during his stay in Wuhan. Although the source of his 2019-nCoV infection is
unknown, evidence of person-to-person transmission has been published. Through January

30, 2020, no secondary cases of 2019-nCoV related to this case have been identified, but
monitoring of close contacts continues.19
Detection of 2019-nCoV RNA in specimens
from the upper respiratory tract with low Ct
values on day 4 and day 7 of illness is suggestive
of high viral loads and potential for transmissibility. It is notable that we also detected 2019nCoV RNA in a stool specimen collected on day
7 of the patient’s illness. Although serum specimens from our case patient were repeatedly
negative for 2019-nCoV, viral RNA has been detected in blood in severely ill patients in China.4
However, extrapulmonary detection of viral RNA
does not necessarily mean that infectious virus
is present, and the clinical significance of the
detection of viral RNA outside the respiratory
tract is unknown at this time.
Currently, our understanding of the clinical
spectrum of 2019-nCoV infection is very limited.
Complications such as severe pneumonia, respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), and cardiac injury, including fatal outcomes, have been reported in China.4,18,20
However, it is important to note that these cases
were identified on the basis of their pneumonia
diagnosis and thus may bias reporting toward
more severe outcomes.
Our case patient initially presented with mild
cough and low-grade intermittent fevers, without evidence of pneumonia on chest radiography
on day 4 of his illness, before having progression to pneumonia by illness day 9. These nonspecific signs and symptoms of mild illness
early in the clinical course of 2019-nCoV infection may be indistinguishable clinically from

Brief Report

In addition, the timing of our case patient’s
progression to pneumonia on day 9 of illness is
consistent with later onset of dyspnea (at a median of 8 days from onset) reported in a recent
publication.4 Although a decision to administer
remdesivir for compassionate use was based on
the case patient’s worsening clinical status, randomized controlled trials are needed to determine the safety and efficacy of remdesivir and
any other investigational agents for treatment of
patients with 2019-nCoV infection.
We report the clinical features of the first
reported patient with 2019-nCoV infection in the
United States. Key aspects of this case included
the decision made by the patient to seek medical
attention after reading public health warnings
about the outbreak; recognition of the patient’s
recent travel history to Wuhan by local providers,
with subsequent coordination among local, state,
and federal public health officials; and identification of possible 2019-nCoV infection, which allowed for prompt isolation of the patient and subsequent laboratory confirmation of 2019-nCoV, as
well as for admission of the patient for further

evaluation and management. This case report
highlights the importance of clinicians eliciting
a recent history of travel or exposure to sick contacts in any patient presenting for medical care
with acute illness symptoms, in order to ensure
appropriate identification and prompt isolation
of patients who may be at risk for 2019-nCoV
infection and to help reduce further transmission. Finally, this report highlights the need to
determine the full spectrum and natural history
of clinical disease, pathogenesis, and duration of
viral shedding associated with 2019-nCoV infection to inform clinical management and public
health decision making.
