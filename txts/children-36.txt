Summary

Background Since December, 2019, an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) has spread globally. Little is
known about the epidemiological and clinical features of paediatric patients with COVID-19.
Methods We retrospectively retrieved data for paediatric patients (aged 0–16 years) with confirmed COVID-19 from
electronic medical records in three hospitals in Zhejiang, China. We recorded patients’ epidemiological and clinical
features.
Findings From Jan 17 to March 1, 2020, 36 children (mean age 8·3 [SD 3·5] years) were identified to be infected with
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2. The route of transmission was by close contact with family members
(32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to the epidemic area (12 [33%]); eight (22%) patients had both exposures. 19 (53%)
patients had moderate clinical type with pneumonia; 17 (47%) had mild clinical type and either were asymptomatic
(ten [28%]) or had acute upper respiratory symptoms (seven [19%]). Common symptoms on admission were fever
(13 [36%]) and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of those with fever, four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher,
and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5–38·5°C. Typical abnormal laboratory findings were elevated creatine
kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and elevated procalcitonin
(six [17%]). Besides radiographic presentations, variables that were associated significantly with severity of COVID-19
were decreased lymphocytes, elevated body temperature, and high levels of procalcitonin, D-dimer, and creatine
kinase MB. All children received interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%) received lopinavir–ritonavir
syrup twice a day, and six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation. Mean time in hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020,
all patients were cured.
Interpretation Although all paediatric patients in our cohort had mild or moderate type of COVID-19, the large
proportion of asymptomatic children indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric patients who do not have clear
epidemiological information, leading to a dangerous situation in community-acquired infections.

Introduction
Coronaviruses are non-segmented positive-stranded
RNA viruses with a roughly 30 kb genome surrounded
by a protein envelope. Most coronaviruses cause diseases
in their particular host species;1 those that can infect
humans through cross-species transmission have
become an important threat to public health. Two serious
coronavirus disease outbreaks have happened in the past
two decades: severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)
in 2003,2 and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS)
in 2012.3
Since December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syn­
drome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) has been recognised
as the causal factor in a series of severe cases of
pneumonia originating in Wuhan in Hubei province,
China.4 This disease has been named coronavirus disease
2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. SARS-CoV-2 has been shown
to cause disease via a mechanism analogous to the SARS

coronavirus, with potential damage to vital organs such
as lung, heart, liver, and kidney, and infection poses a
considerable risk to patients by the high prevalence of
pneumonia.5 By March 1, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 had led
to 80 
981 confirmed cases of COVID-19 in China,
and 44 067 cases in 117 countries.6 A cohort study of
44 672 Chinese cases reported that 2·1% of patients were
younger than 20 years, and 1·2% were asymptomatic.7
Pneumonia is the leading cause of mortality in
children.8 Distinct immunological responses to viral
infections can exist in children and result in severe
damage to vital organs.9 Although short-to-medium-term
outcomes for children who recovered from SARS seemed
good, the disease caused exercise impairment after more
than 6 months.10 A comprehensive literature search
indicated that MERS was rare in children (31 cases
identified between 2012 and 2016),11 because transmission
depends heavily on animal exposure and direct contact

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed from Nov 1, 2019, to March 1, 2020, for
studies published in any language using the terms “COVID-19”,
“coronavirus disease 2019”, “novel coronavirus”, “pediatric
patients”, “children”, “transmission”, “clinical feature”,
and “epidemiological features”. We found 13 studies about
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) in children. These studies
were related to treatment recommendations, CT features in
15 children, case reports, and COVID-19 in infants. To our
knowledge, no study has been done to comprehensively
investigate a cohort of paediatric patients with COVID-19 and
their distinctive clinical features. Published work about adult
patients has shown that manifestations vary strikingly by
individual. Since children are different from adults in many
aspects, such as immunological development, we aimed to
investigate the clinical and epidemiological features of
paediatric patients with COVID-19.
Added value of this study
Between Jan 17 and March 1, 2020, 661 cases of COVID-19 were
reported in Ningbo and Wenzhou (Zhejiang province, China).
Of these cases, 36 were in children. All children with COVID-19

in the household or health-care facilities. Collectively,
these two coronavirus diseases did not widely affect
children because of the short-term epidemic of SARS
and the strict transmission route of MERS. In a study of
15 children with COVID-19 (aged 4–14 years), six patients
had small nodular ground-glass opacities in the lungs.12
At the time of the COVID-19 outbreak, all schools were
on the spring festival holiday, which might have
prevented children from exposure to transmission
sources. However, the school community is a place that
can enhance rapid spread of the highly infectious
SARS-CoV-2.
Ningbo and Wenzhou are two cities in Zhejiang
province, located 900 km east of Wuhan. On Jan 17, 2020,
the first COVID-19 case was reported in Wenzhou. Up to
March 1, 2020, 661 cases of COVID-19 had been reported
in Ningbo and Wenzhou, of which 36 were in children.
We aimed to describe the epidemiological and clinical
features of these paediatric patients, information that is
urgently needed for prevention and treatment of
COVID-19 in children.

Methods

Study population
We did an observational cohort study at three hospitals in
Zhejiang province, China (Ningbo Women and Children’s
Hospital, The Third Affiliated Hospital of Wenzhou
Medical University, and Wenzhou Central Hospital of
Wenzhou). We included all paediatric patients (aged
0–16 years) with laboratory confirmed COVID-19. The
diagnosis of COVID-19 was based on guidelines issued by
the National Health Commission of the People’s Republic
2	

had been infected either by close contact with adults infected
with severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2) or by exposure to the epidemic area. Although
fever, cough, and pneumonia were the most common signs,
about half the children had mild disease with no presenting
symptoms. Fewer children with COVID-19 had obvious
symptoms compared with adult patients with COVID-19 and
paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza described in previous
studies.
Implications of all the available evidence
By contrast with findings in adults, children with COVID-19 had
milder clinical manifestations; nearly half of paediatric
patients were asymptomatic (ie, no fever and no cough).
This asymptomatic condition is relevant if community-acquired
transmission becomes the primary mode; identification of
paediatric patients without presenting symptoms will become a
great challenge. Fortunately, the number of children infected with
SARS-CoV-2 accounted for a small proportion of total people
infected, and paediatric patients also had clear epidemiological
information. Devising measures to protect children from
infection with SARS-CoV-2 is very important.

of China.13 We screened all patients who had cough, fever,
and radiographic presentation at the initial assessment, or
who underwent epidemiological investigation because of a
history of exposure to epidemic areas or close contact
with an infected individual. We confirmed SARS-CoV-2
infection by RT-PCR of samples taken from upper naso­
pharyngeal swabs. Epide­
miological investigation was
focused on the route of transmission, and we assessed
travel history, residence in epidemic areas, and close
contact with patients with confirmed COVID-19 within
14 days.
This study was approved by the ethics committee of
Ningbo Women and Children’s Hospital and followed the
Declaration of Helsinki. Written consent was obtained
from the guardians of the patients.

Procedures
Sample collection, RT-PCR, and interpretation of results
was done as previously described.14 Two sets of primers
were used for two target genes (ie, open reading frame 1ab
[ORF1ab] and nucleocapsid protein [N]) according to the
protocol issued by the National Institute for Viral Disease
Control and Prevention in China (panel 1).15
On admission, patients were assessed for clinical
type, according to guidelines for scoring paediatric
patients with COVID-19 (recommendations issued by the
paediatrics branch of the Chinese Medical Association;
panel 2).16 The therapeutic principles included general
support therapy; monitoring of lung, liver, kidney, and
myocardial functions; active control over high fever;
oxygen uptake if necessary; and antiviral treatment
with interferon alfa and lopinavir–ritonavir. Treatment

(Left) CT of 10-year-old boy showing multiple opacities in lower lobes of both lungs (arrow). (Right) CT of
1·5-year-old girl showing multiple ground-glass opacities with a big patchy opacity in the right lung (arrows).

We obtained data retrospectively from electronic
medical records, and these were reviewed by two trained
doctors (LH and YL). Information retrieved included
demographic data, medical history, exposure history,
underlying comorbidities, symptoms, laboratory exam­
ina­
tions, chest CT scans, and treatment. Laboratory
examinations included routine testing, analysis of immu­
no­logical responses, and measurement of bio­markers for
monitoring lung, liver, myocardial, and renal functions.
We compared the prevalence of abnormal clinical indices
of the paediatric patients with previously reported data
for 175 adults with COVID-19 in Wenzhou,17 44 paediatric
patients with SARS in Hong Kong,10,18 and 167 Chinese
paediatric patients with H1N1 influenza.19

Statistical analysis
We presented continuous variables as mean (SD) and
categorical variables as number (%). We compared means
of continuous variables between groups using inde­
pendent group t tests when values were normally dis­
tributed; otherwise, we used the Mann-Whitney U test.
We compared proportions for categorical variables
4	

bet­
ween groups using Fisher’s exact test, because of
limited numbers. We judged a two-sided α less than 0·05
statistically significant. All data analyses were done with
SPSS version 20.

Results
Between Jan 17 and March 1, 2020, 661 COVID-19 cases
were reported in Ningbo and Wenzhou in China; of these
cases, 36 (5%) were in children (aged 1–16 years; mean
age 8·3 [3·5] years). 13 (36%) of 36 patients were female
(table 1). The route of transmission for paediatric patients
was either by close contact with family members with
COVID-19 (32 [89%]) or a history of exposure to epidemic
areas (12 [33%]), or both (eight [22%]). 17 (47%) of
36 children had mild clinical type, with ten (28%) patients
asymptomatic and seven (19%) showing acute upper
respiratory symptoms. The remaining 19 (53%) paediatric
patients had moderate clinical type, characteristic of mild
pneumonia (table 1). No severe and critically ill cases were
seen.
On admission, frequent symptoms were fever (13 [36%])
and dry cough (seven [19%]). Of 13 patients with fever,
four (11%) had a body temperature of 38·5°C or higher
and nine (25%) had a body temperature of 37·5–38·5°C.
Other symptoms were recorded infrequently, including
sore throat (two [6%]), pharyngeal congestion (one [3%]),
dyspnoea or tachypnoea (one [3%]), and vomiting or
diarrhoea (two [6%]). Neither neurological symptoms nor
signs of cardiac, liver, or renal failure were recorded.
Generally, two types of abnormal radiographic presen­
tations were seen: multiple opacities and patchy opacities.
19 (53%) paediatric patients had pulmonary ground-glass
opacities on CT scan, suggesting pneu­monia (figure 1).
Pneumonia plus either fever or cough was seen in
11 (30%) paediatric patients and eight (22%) had pneu­
monia as the only symptom. Ten (28%) children showed
no symptoms of pneumonia, five (14%) reported fever
only, and two (5%) only had a dry cough.
Table 1 shows findings of laboratory examinations
related to immunological responses and cardiac, liver,
and renal damage, according to mild or moderate clinical
type. Abnormal findings in paediatric patients were
increased serum creatine kinase MB (11 [31%]), decreased
lymphocytes (11 [31%]), leucopenia (seven [19%]), and
increased procalcitonin (six [17%]). Some features
differed significantly between mild and moderate clinical
type of COVID-19, including decreased lymphocytes
(p=0·0083), raised body temperature (p=0·0020), and
high levels of procalcitonin (p=0·0039), D-dimer
(p=0·028), and creatine kinase MB (p=0·0084). Children

with moderate clinical type also had a positive PCR result
for longer (p=0·0050) and spent more days in hospital
(p=0·017) than did those with mild clinical type.
Table 2 shows findings of laboratory examinations
related to immunological responses and cardiac, liver,
and renal damage, according to age group. Ten patients
were aged 5 years or younger and 26 patients were
16 years or younger but older than 5 years. The older
children had decreased lymphocytes (p=0·029), elevated
procalcitonin (p=0·032), and decreased creatine kinase
(p=0·032) compared with the younger patients.
Treatments and primary manifestations were traced to
assess disease progression and outcome, and four case
types were identified: asymptomatic, upper respiratory
symptoms or fever only, pneumonia only, and both
pneumonia and upper respiratory symptoms or fever
(figure 2). On admission, all children were treated with
interferon alfa by aerosolisation twice a day, 14 (39%)
received lopinavir–ritonavir syrup twice a day, and
six (17%) needed oxygen inhalation (table 1). In the
13 patients with fever, mean duration of fever was 3 (SD 2)
days. Improve­ment in pneumonia was seen 4–10 days
after treatment initiation. SARS-CoV-2 RT-PCR results
became negative after a mean of 10 (SD 2) days of
treatment, regardless of the various initial manifestations
of patients (figure 2). The mean number of days in
hospital was 14 (SD 3) days. By Feb 28, 2020, all patients
were cured, according to the criteria for cured outcome,
and quarantined for a further 2 weeks. Follow-up is
continuing every week, with samples taken to measure
serum IgG and IgM and SARS-CoV-2 in blood, faeces,
and nasopharyngeal swabs.
The comparison of paediatric patients with COVID-19
with adult patients with COVID-19 in the same city
(table 3) showed that paediatric patients had a
significantly lower prevalence of abnormal values of
several variables indicating disease severity, such as
fever (36% for children and 86% for adults), cough
(19% and 62%), pneumonia (53% and 95%), elevated
C-reactive protein (3% and 49%), and severe disease
type (0% and 23%; p<0·0001 for all features).
Nevertheless, no differences were noted between
children and adults in prevalence of leucopenia,
lymphopenia, and elevated myocardial enzymes. When
compared with children with SARS, paediatric patients
with COVID-19 had much milder disease in terms of
the prevalence of fever, cough, pneumonia, and severe
case type. Compared with children with H1N1 influenza,
paediatric patients with COVID-19 had fewer upper
respiratory symptoms (eg, cough and pharyngeal
congestion) but pneumonia was more frequent. Notably,
when the three groups of patients with coronavirus
infections were compared with the paediatric patients
with H1N1 influenza, the most striking difference was
that patients with H1N1 influenza had a much higher
prevalence of pharyngeal congestion and a lower
prevalence of pneumonia.

Discussion
SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging contagious pathogen
causing a high prevalence of pneumonia in infected
individuals. Understanding the clinical features in
paediatric patients is important for diagnosis and
effective treatment of this illness. The findings of our
study show that the main clinical features of COVID-19
in children were fever, dry cough, and pneumonia.
Paediatric patients acquired COVID-19 by clear
transmission routes, including close contact with family
members, a history of exposure to epidemic areas, or
both of these. No other sources, such as a hospital stay or

unclear routes of transmission, were identified. This
transmission feature means that identification of
these paediatric patients was straightforward. However,
previous work has shown that potential transmission
routes of SARS-CoV-2 can be highly variable,20 compared
with MERS coronavirus, which is less transmissible.11
This situation could be altered if COVID-19 persists for a
long time in an area with increased risk for communityacquired infections.
Among the paediatric patients in our study, just under
a third were asymptomatic. Moreover, a fifth had
pneumonia only and needed radiographic examination to
be identified. Symptoms seen on admission were variable,
including cough and fever. All asymptomatic patients and
children who did not present with pneu­monia needed
laboratory and radiographic examinations for diagnosis.
The large proportion of children with asymptomatic
SARS-CoV-2 infection contrasts with paediatric patients
with H1N1 influenza19 and SARS,10 and adult patients with
COVID-19,17 in terms of presenting symptoms such as
cough and pharyngeal congestion (table 3), indicating
SARS-CoV-2 has little effect on the upper respiratory tract
of children. COVID-19 is highly transmissible, similar to
SARS and H1N1 influenza, but can have a covert
presentation in children.
Pneumonia is the leading infectious cause of death in
children younger than 5 years.21 Although COVID-19 in
children seemed to be mild in term of presenting symptoms,
the prevalence of pneumonia with COVID-19 (53%) was
higher than with H1N1 influenza (11%), but very similar to
the prevalence with SARS (65%).18 A striking characteristic
of COVID-19 is that it affects several vital organs (eg, lungs
and heart), as shown by increased amounts of myocardial
enzymes, even though all children with COVID-19 had the
mild or moderate clinical type (table 3). With high mortality
in adult patients with COVID-19 in epidemic areas6
(eg, >4% mortality in Wuhan), paediatric patients should
continue to be monitored after discharge from hospital.
Compared with adults, children rarely have comorbid­
ities such as hypertension, cardiovascular disease, and
diabetes. Paediatric patients in our study had a lower
prevalence of pneumonia and symptoms such as fever,
cough, and dyspnoea compared with adult patients with
COVID-19 (table 3). However, in our study, the prevalence
of leucopenia, lymphopenia, and increased myocardial
enzymes in children with COVID-19 was similar to that in
adults. Notably, adults have a much higher prevalence of
increased C-reactive protein than do children, suggesting
a much milder immunological response in children and
less immune damage.22 Except for antiviral drugs, no
special treatments (eg, glucocorticoid therapy and invasive
mechanical ventilation) were administered, and few
children needed inhaled oxygen. Taking all these findings
into con­
sideration, the presentation of COVID-19 in
paediatric patients is much milder than in adults. It is
noteworthy that few patients with coronavirus disease
(ie, COVID-19 and SARS) have pharyngeal congestion or

sore throat, which contrasts with patients with H1N1
influenza, despite the high prevalence of cough and fever
in all patients. Pharyngeal congestion is more like an
upper respiratory symptom than is fever (which is a
systemic symptom) and cough, which can also be induced
by a lower respiratory infection.
The findings of our study also showed that, although
all paediatric cases were mild or moderate, the number
of days spent in hospital and time needed for these
patients to have negative PCR results was still
considerable (table 1, figure 2). The time to achieve a
negative PCR result seemed to be unaffected by severity
of disease in terms of symptoms and the presence of
pneumonia and treatment choices. Nevertheless, fever
resolved faster in mild cases than in moderate cases
(figure 2). Considering that delayed clearance of viral
RNA in patients’ stools is a potential risk for
transmission,23 particularly in patients in rehabilitation,
the reliability of viral RNA-negative criteria in
asymptomatic patients, in the long run, needs further
investigation.
The major limitation of our study was the small sample
size. However, most results were consistent within the
study and, with several case reports on children with
COVID-19, we believe our conclusions are valid. Since
COVID-19 is spreading in more countries and has
become an urgent public health event, we present an
early report on paediatric patients and expect additional
data to improve our findings.

In conclusion, our study shows that paediatric patients
with COVID-19 have a simple transmission mode, either
by close contact with infected adults or by exposure to
epidemic areas. Although fever, dry cough, and mild
pneumonia are common manifestations, nearly half of
patients have neither obvious symptoms nor abnormal
radiological findings. The proportion of asymptomatic
cases indicates the difficulty in identifying paediatric
patients without clear epidemiological information. This
finding suggests a dangerous situation if communityacquired infections occur.
