SARS-CoV-2 Infection among Travelers
Returning from Wuhan, China
To the Editor: As severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) infections
(causing coronavirus disease 2019 [Covid-19])
spread globally, uncertainty surrounds estimates
of the true number of infected persons, which is

crucial to determining the severity of infection
and the incidence of mild or asymptomatic cases
and their possible transmission.1 Modeling estimates suggest that in Wuhan, China, the city with
the most Covid-19 cases, there are substantially

January 30, 2020: 97 persons arrived
for boarding at an airport in Wuhan, China
3 Febrile persons were denied
boarding
Same day: 94 boarded an evacuation flight
in Wuhan and arrived in Singapore
2 Febrile persons (Patients 1 and 2)
were transferred to a hospital
on arrival in Singapore

2 Tested positive for SARS-CoV-2

Before February 2, 2020, 6 persons
reported symptoms and were
transferred to a hospital

6 Tested negative for SARS-CoV-2

Same day: 92 were transferred to a
government quarantine facility

February 2, 2020: 76 of 86 persons
were tested for SARS-CoV-2 at the
government quarantine facility
1 Asymptomatic person (Patient 3)
tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 and
1 person had an indeterminate result;
both were transferred to a hospital
February 5, 2020: all 87 persons at the
government quarantine facility were tested
for SARS-CoV-2 and had negative results

All isolated persons were released from
the government quarantine facility after
a 14-day quarantine period

Figure 1. Follow-up of 94 Persons who Boarded an Evacuation Flight from Wuhan, China, to Singapore on January 30,
2020.
Of the 6 persons who had been transferred to a hospital before February 2, 2020, 3 returned to the government
quarantine facility and are included with the 87 persons who underwent testing at the facility on quarantine day 6
(February 5, 2020). SARS-CoV-2 denotes severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2.

more cases than were officially reported, because
milder cases may not have been captured in
hospital-based surveillance.2,3 Data on travelers
returning from areas with cases of Covid-19
could be useful in estimating its incidence.4
We followed up on 94 persons who boarded
an evacuation flight from Wuhan to Singapore on
January 30, 2020. Screening for body temperature
was conducted at check-in and before boarding,
and 3 febrile persons were prevented from boarding (Fig. 1); no additional information regarding
the status of these 3 febrile persons was available. Surgical masks were provided to passengers
on board the plane. On arrival in Singapore, the
passengers underwent repeat screening for body
temperature (fever was defined as a body temperature ≥38°C), and 2 persons (a woman 48 years
of age [Patient 1] and a woman 47 years of age
[Patient 2]) had a fever. The 2 febrile women
were transferred immediately to a hospital, and
they tested positive for SARS-CoV-2 (their clinical course is described in the Supplementary Appendix, available with the full text of this letter
at NEJM.org).
The remaining 92 afebrile passengers (age
range, 2 to 82 years) were quarantined for 14 days
at a government quarantine facility, where they
were checked for symptoms and fever three times
daily. Six persons reported symptoms (4 on quarantine day 2 and 2 on quarantine day 3) and
were placed in isolation in a hospital and underwent polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) testing;
all 6 persons tested negative for SARS-CoV-2.
On quarantine day 3, samples from 76 of the 86
asymptomatic persons (75 nasopharyngeal swab
samples and 1 nasal swab sample) were obtained
and tested by means of PCR. A 17-year-old boy (the
son of Patient 1) tested positive for Covid-19 and
continued to have PCR-positive status for 2 weeks,
and a 41-year-old man had an inconclusive result
(positive for N gene and negative for ORF1ab gene).
On quarantine day 6, samples from all 87 quarantined asymptomatic persons (85 nasopharyngeal
swab samples and 2 nasal swab samples [3 of the
6 persons who had been transferred to the hospital before February 2 had returned to the government quarantine facility]) were obtained and
tested; all tested negative. All persons who were
not isolated in the hospital were released from
quarantine on day 14, and all remained uninfected with Covid-19. Understanding the impli-

cations of transmission of SARS-CoV-2 infection
from persons with asymptomatic or very mild
symptomatic cases of Covid-19 is vital for the
formulation of containment strategies.
