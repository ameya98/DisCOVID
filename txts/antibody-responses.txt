pathogenic diagnosis for COVID- in the early phase of infection. A higher titer of Ab was
independently associated with a worse clinical classification.



Abstract
Background
The novel coronavirus SARS-CoV- is a newly emerging virus. The antibody response in
infected patient remains largely unknown, and the clinical values of antibody testing have not
been fully demonstrated.

A total of  patients with SARS-CoV- infection were enrolled. Their serial plasma
samples (n=) collected during the hospitalization were tested for total antibodies (Ab),
IgM and IgG against SARS-CoV-. The dynamics of antibodies with the disease progress
was analyzed.
Results
Among  patients, the seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and IgG was .%, .% and
.%, respectively. The reason for the negative antibody findings in  patients might due
to the lack of blood samples at the later stage of illness. The median seroconversion time for
Ab, IgM and then IgG were day-, day- and day-, separately. The presence of
antibodies was <% among patients within -week since onset, and rapidly increased to
.% (Ab), .% (IgM) and .% (IgG) since day- after onset. In contrast, RNA
detectability decreased from .% (/) in samples collected before day- to .%
(/) during day -. Combining RNA and antibody detections significantly improved the
sensitivity of pathogenic diagnosis for COVID- (p<.), even in early phase of -week
since onset (p=.). Moreover, a higher titer of Ab was independently associated with a
worse clinical classification (p=.).
Conclusions
The antibody detection offers vital clinical information during the course of SARS-CoV-
infection. The findings provide strong empirical support for the routine application of
serological testing in the diagnosis and management of COVID- patients.

Introduction
Since early December of  and up to March , , over , cases of coronavirus
disease  (COVID-) caused by novel coronavirus (SARS-CoV-) infection, with over
, deaths have been reported in  countries. The World Health Organization

to recent reports, most of COVID- patients have an incubation period of  to  days.
Fever, cough and fatigue are the most common symptoms, whereas nasal congestion, runny
and diarrhea are only noted in a small part of the patients. Severe cases might rapidly
progress to acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), septic shock and difficult-to-tackle
metabolic acidosis and bleeding and coagulation dysfunction. It should be noted that some
of COVID- patients only had mild atypical symptoms initially, even for severe and critical
cases. The chest computed tomography of COVID- patients were characterized by the
ground-glass opacity and bilateral patchy shadowing. For laboratory test, it was reported
that most of patients had lymphopenia and elevated C-reactive protein. However, the
above-mentioned clinical and laboratory characteristics are not easily distinguishable from
pneumonia induced by infection with other common respiratory tract pathogens.
The timely and accurate diagnosis of the SARS-CoV- infection is the cornerstone of the
efforts to provide appropriated treatment for patients, to limit further spread of the virus and
ultimately to eliminate the virus from human society. Currently, PCR-based viral RNA
detection is almost the only way to confirm the diagnosis of SARS-CoV- infection in
practice. On the other hand, RNA testing based on throat or nasopharyngeal swabs brought
out negligible false-negative risk. The reported positive rate varied for different swab
specimens in COVID- patients. , Many cases that were strongly epidemiologically linked
to SARS-CoV- exposure and with typical lung radiological findings remained RNA negative
in their upper respiratory tract samples. The performance of RT-PCR depends on many
factors such as the sample types, different stage of infection in patients, the skill of sample
collection, and the quality and consistency of the PCR assays being used. These problems

serious challenge to providing timely life support treatment and preventive quarantine.
Comparing to PCR, serological testing is advantageous with faster turn-around time, highthroughput and less workload. However, the clinical value of antibodies largely depends on

newly emerging virus, the antibody response in COVID- patients remains largely
unknown. This study investigates the dynamics of total antibody (Ab), IgM and IgG antibody
against SARS-CoV- in serial blood samples collected from  confirmed COVID-
patients and provides discussion on the clinical value of antibody testing.
Methods
Patients
A confirmed COVID- case and the clinical classification was defined based on the New
Coronavirus Pneumonia Prevention and Control Program (th edition) published by the
National Health Commission of China. Briefly, patient with acute respiratory infection
syndromes and/or abnormalities in chest CT images accompanied by detectable SARSCoV- RNA in respiratory sample since illness onset for at least one time was confirmed as
COVID- case. Patients were classified as in critical illness condition with ARDS or oxygen
saturation <% who required mechanical ventilation either invasively or non-invasively.
This study enrolls a total of  cases of COVID-, where all patients were admitted to the
Shenzhen Third People’s Hospital between Jan  and Feb , , and were willing to
donate their blood samples. All enrolled cases were confirmed to be infected with SARSCoV- by use of real-time RT-PCR (rRT-PCR) on samples from the respiratory tract. For all
enrolled patients, the date of illness onset, clinical classification, RNA testing results during
the hospitalization period, and the personal demographic information were obtained from the
clinical records. This study was reviewed and approved by the Medical Ethical Committee of

each enrolled patient.
Antibody measurement
The Ab, IgM antibody and IgG antibody against SARS-CoV- in plasma samples were

Biological Pharmacy Enterprise Co.,Ltd, according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly,
the ELISA for total antibodies detection was developed based on double-antigens sandwich
immunoassay (Ab-ELISA), using mammalian cell expressed recombinant antigens contained
the receptor binding domain (RBD) of the spike protein of SARS-CoV- as the immobilized
and HRP-conjugated antigen. The IgM μ-chain capture method (IgM-ELISA) was used to
detect the IgM antibodies, using the same HRP-conjugate RBD antigen as the Ab-ELISA.
The IgG antibodies were tested using indirect ELISA kit (IgG-ELISA) based on a
recombinant nucleoprotein. The specificity of the assays for Ab, IgM and IgG was
determined as .% (/), .% (/) and .% (/) by testing of
samples collected from healthy individuals before the outbreak of SARS-CoV-.
Statistical analysis
For continue variables description, mean with standard deviation was used for normal
distribution data and median with interquartile range (IQR) was used for non-normal
distribution data. Cumulative seroconversion rates were calculated by Kaplan-Meier method.
The association between antibody level and severity of illness were estimated by
generalized estimating equations (GEE) model with logit link function. All statistical analysis
was conducted by SAS . (SAS Institute, Cary, NC, USA).

Results
The characterization of patients
Among totally  COVID- patients admitted in the hospital (before Feb , ),  of
them (%) were enrolled in the study (Table ). The median age of the studied patients was

epidemiological travel/residence history in Wuhan. Among them,  (.%) were in critical
illness condition. By February , a total of  patients (.%) were recovered and
discharged from hospital and  (.%) patients died with underlying chronic disease.
Seroconversion of antibodies against SARS-CoV- in COVID- patients
A total of  plasma samples collected during the hospitalization period of the  patients
were tested for antibodies against SARS-CoV-. The seroconversion rate for Ab, IgM and
IgG was .% (/), .% (/) and .% (/), respectively (Table ).
Twelve patients who remained seronegative for Ab testing possibly due to that their samples
involved were all collected at the early stage of illness ( earlier than day-, the other two
on day- and- after onset). The cumulative seroconversion curve showed that the rate
for Ab and IgM reached % around -month after onset. The seroconversion was
sequential appeared for Ab, IgM and then IgG (Figure A). The median time to Ab, IgM and
IgG seroconversion was -, - and -day, separately. One of two patients tested on the
onset day was seropositive. Overall, the seroconversion of Ab was significantly quicker than
that of IgM (p = .) and IgG (p<.), that possibly attributed to the double-antigen
sandwich form of the assay used which usually show much higher sensitivity than capture
assay (IgM) and indirect assay (IgG). Moreover, all isotypes of viral specific antibodies,
including IgM, IgA and IgG, can be detected by double-sandwich assay, which may also
contribute to the superior performance of Ab test. In comparisons of seroconversion rates of
antibodies between critical and non-critical patients, none of the three markers showed
significant difference (data not shown).

 years (IQR, -) and .% were females. There were  (%) patients had clear

The diagnosis value of antibody assays for patients in different time after onset
In the early phase of illness within -day since onset, the RNA test had the highest sensitivity
of .%, whereas the antibody assays only presented a positive rate of .% (Table ).
However, the sensitivity of Ab overtook that of RNA test since day  after onset and reached

after onset, the sensitivities of Ab (.%), IgM (.%) and IgG (.%) were all higher
than that of RNA test (.%, Table ). Among samples from patients in later phase (day  since onset), the sensitivities of Ab, IgM and IgG were .%, .% and .%,
respectively. In contrast, RNA was only detectable in .% of samples of day -.
Further analyses demonstrated that in patients with undetectable RNA in their respiratory
tract samples collected during day -, day -, day - and day - since onset, there
were .% (/), .% (/), .% (/) and % (/) had detectable antibody
in total Ab assay, respectively (Table S). Whatever, combined use of the tests of RNA and
Ab improved markedly the sensitivities of pathogenic-diagnosis for COVID- patients in
different phases (Table ).
The dynamics of antibody levels with the progress and severity of disease
To investigate the dynamics of antibody level according disease course, the antibody levels
were expressed using the relative binding signals compared to the cutoff value of each
assay (S/CO). The longitudinal changes of antibody and RNA in  representative patients,
including  in non-critical group (Figure A) and  in critical group (Figure B), were
presented in Figure . The first positive time point of RNA tests appeared earlier than that of
Ab in  of  patients, except for the case  (Ab was detectable  days earlier than RNA)
and the case  (at the same day). It should be noted that the risings of antibodies were
not always accompanied by RNA clearance, particularly in the  critical patients. This finding
suggested that antibodies may not be sufficient to clear the virus. In the pooled analyses on
all involved patients, the average antibody levels showed a marked increase since about -

over % across day  after onset (Figure B). In samples from patients during day -

week after onset and continuously elevated during the next  weeks (Figure A). Further
analyses suggested that there was no significant difference on the average S/CO value of
Ab tests between critical and non-critical patients before day  after onset (Figure B).
However, critical patients showed significantly higher Ab S/CO values than non-critical cases

IgG tests (data not shown). For further exploration, we determined the relative Ab titer of
these samples (expressed as relative optical density, rOD) by serial dilution measurements
of each sample. The quantitative data of Ab titers also revealed a significant difference
(p=.) between patients in critical and non-critical groups (Figure C). Multivariate
longitudinal GEE analyses suggested that age (β=., p <.), gender (β=.,
p=.) and Ab titer (β=., p=.) were the independent factors strongly associated
with the clinical classification based on the severity (Table S).
Discussion
The present data demonstrated that typical antibody responses to acute viral infection are
wildly induced in COVID- patients. To be expected, the total antibody was first detected,
followed by IgM and IgG. The seroconversion rate and the antibody levels increased rapidly
during the first two weeks, the cumulative seropositive rate reached % on the th-day and
% on the th-day. The seroconversion time of Ab, IgM and IgG antibodies appeared
consequently (p<.) with a median seroconversion day of ,  and , respectively.
Due to the lack of blood samples collected from patients in the later stage of illness, how
long the antibodies could last remain unknown. Our results demonstrated an excellent
sensitivity of Ab test in detections of patient’s samples since -week after onset. Notably,
even in the early stages of the illness within -week, some patients with undetectable RNA
could be screened out through Ab testing. Combining RNA and antibody tests significantly
raised the sensitivity for detecting patients (p<.). These findings indicate that serological
test be an important supplement to RNA detection during the illness course.

in about -week after onset (p=.) and this association was not significant in either IgM or

Up to date, the confirm diagnosis of SARS-CoV- infection entirely depend on the viral RNA
testing. Even though with high analytical sensitivity, the real-world performance of RNA test
is unsatisfied. Many suspected patients had to be tested for several days with multiple
samples before confirm diagnosis were made, and during the waiting time they might have

problems make the timely diagnosis of SARS-CoV- infection one of the bottlenecks for
adapting relevant actions to limit the damage of current outbreak. Our study provided robust
evidences that: ) the acute antibody response in SARS-CoV- infection patient is very
similar to many other acute viral infections; ) the serological testing can be a powerful
approach in achieving timely diagnosis; and ) the total antibody is more sensitive than IgM
and IgG for detecting SARS-CoV- infection.
Thus, the antibody testing might play vital roles in the following settings: ) for the suspected
patients under the initial visit or clinically diagnosed patients has not been confirmed by RNA
testing, the positive result of antibody increases the confidence to make a COVID-
diagnosis; ) for healthy close contact who is in the quarantine period, he/she should be
deemed as a probable carriers if antibody positive, then the RNA should be tested more
frequently and the close contacts of him/her should be observed; ) for the RNA confirmed
patient, seropositive indicates that the specific antibodies had been induced. Besides,
epidemiological studies could be conducted using immunoassays. Additional, it can play an
important role in searching potential animal hosts for SARS-CoV- using Ab-ELISA because
the double-sandwich method makes it free from species restriction. It has been less than
three months since the SARS-CoV- first invaded humans, and the prevalence of antibody
against SARS-CoV- is nearly zero. Therefore, at least during the current outbreak which is
likely to continue to May or June , seropositive individuals could be a probably
preceding infector. During this short-period, the total antibody could be considered as a
recent infection marker similar as IgM. As the higher sensitivity than IgM and IgG, the Ab
detection should be given high priority to be implemented in current clinical and public health

not enough priority to receive relevant treatments and quarantine managements. These

practice. If, unfortunately, SARS-CoV- become a common respiratory transmission
pathogen lasting in humans, like influenzas or other less-pathogenic coronaviruses, rather
than be completely eradicated as SARS-CoV-, the serological diagnosis of acute SARSCoV- infection will more depend on the detection of IgM in post-epidemic areas in the

epidemiology of SARS-CoV- infection and to assist in determining the level of humoral
immunity in patients. Even then, the Ab will be a more sensitive marker for sentinel
monitoring of imported cases in naive community.
In addition to the diagnosis value, our study revealed a strong positive correlation between
clinical severity and Ab titer since -week after illness onset, for the first time in COVID-
patients. The results suggested that a high Ab titer may be considered as a risk factor of
critical illness, independently from older age, male gender and comorbidities (Table S).
Although it was still unclear how the causal relation between hormonal response and illness
severity, the results raise a possible usage of the high Ab titer as a surrogate marker for
worse clinical prognosis. Furthermore, it might be an evidence for the possibility of antibodydependent disease enhancement effects, which was commonly found in SARS-CoV-
patients.- Whatsoever, our finding suggested that the clinical meanings of the level of
antibody against SARS-CoV- during the acute phase of infection warrant further study.
It should be noted that there were some limitations of this study. First, for most of RNA tests
of the patients were based on upper respiratory tract specimens, the positive rate may be
higher in detection using lower respiratory tract specimens, such as bronchoalveolar lavage
fluid and deep tracheal aspirates, may yield higher sensitivity for RNA tests. Second, all the
patients enrolled in this study were based on the positive findings of RT-PCR using
respiratory samples. Untypical patients with lower respiratory viral load might be missed.
Besides, the performance of RT-PCR depends on many factors such as the quality and
consistency of the PCR assays being used, the skill of sample collection, and the sample
types. Also, RT-PCR cannot distinguish the viable replicating virus and simply residual RNA,

which may affect the results. Third, we cannot evaluate the persistence of antibodies
because samples were collected during the acute phase of patients. Fourth, although it had
shown good specificity in healthy people, the cross-reactivity of the assay to other
coronaviruses should be further assessed.

addition to RNA tests. These findings provide strong evidence for the routine application of
serological antibody assays in the diagnosis and clinical management of COVID- patients.
