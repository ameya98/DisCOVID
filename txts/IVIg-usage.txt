The outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause that first occurred in Wuhan, China,
December , has recently been assessed by WHO as a pandemic. The pneumonia is
caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus

designated coronavirus disease  (COVID-) by WHO. As of March , , a
total of  cases had been reported in China, including  reported deaths.
Meanwhile, number of confirmed patients continues to grow out of China and

cases had already been reported[]. The relatively high infectivity, rapid progression of

an

lung involvement, and lack of definite effective treatment, make it urgent to develop

M

efficient measures of management based on the pathogenesis of COVID-. Although
many empirical therapeutic options have been introduced on several operational

ed

recommendations, including existing and new generation of antivirals, steroids, and
traditional Chinese medicine, the optimal strategy for severe COVID- remains

ce

unclear.

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV- infection is quite wide, and includes

Ac

asymptomatic infection, mild type with only upper respiratory tract illness, common
type with pulmonary infiltrations, severe type with respiratory distress and critically ill
patients that needs intubation or intensive care[]. Clinical features of those with
pneumonia include fever, cough, and in many cases a sudden and accelerating
respiratory distress originated from interstitial pneumonia. In those who rapidly
progressed to critical conditions, reduced peripheral lymphocyte counts and elevated
inflammatory factors were observed, indicating an overwhelming immune response[,

Discussion

Although confirmed cases of COVID- rapidly accumulated during the past two

Ac

months, our understanding of the clinical spectrum and pathophysiological changes of
this infection still remains very limited. Nevertheless, no definite treatment has been
identified, which makes it extremely difficult for clinical management. Here we report
a case series of COVID-, all of whom were successfully treated by high-dose IVIg at
the early stage of clinical deterioration. Based on these observations, a high-dose IVIg
administered at the appropriate point, could successfully block the progression of
disease cascade, and finally improve the outcome of COVID-.

The natural history of SARS-CoV- infection does not simply resemble any of the
previously known coronaviruses. Up to date, we have noticed quite a wide clinical
spectrum of SARS-CoV- infection, including asymptomatic infection, mild upper

t

reported symptomatic cases including our patients and many others, followed a similar
track of progression. The infection often started with mild or moderate unspecific
symptoms, including but is not limited to low-grade fever, sore throat, coughing, fatigue

us

and malaise, similar to that of a common cold. The initial symptoms would alleviate or

an

persist for around - days, when high-grade fever developed and respiratory distress

M

became quite prominent. Some of these patients would also have gastrointestinal
symptoms during this period. However, if we look at the CT series as shown here, which

ed

were quite typical of most COVID- patients, we would have a very strong impression
that most of the lesions started from the peripheral, especially the subpleural region

ce
pt

when ARDS developed[]. These features indicated an hematogenous or lymphatic
distribution or spreading of pathogenic factors rather than direct inspiration.

Ac

Based on these observations, we deduced that symptomatic COVID- mainly

consists of three phases, including a starting phase, spanning the acquisition of the virus
and subsequent viremia; and in many but not all patients an accelerating phase, when
virus-induced secondary damage of targeting organs and tissue occurs, including the
lungs, the heart, the gastrointestinal tract, and even an overall inflammatory storm. The
third phase is the final recovery phase. This was demonstrated by not only the clinical
features but also the laboratory dynamics, including progressive lymphocytopenia and

COVID- should also be specified according to the course of infection. The best
timing of antivirals, if there are any, may lie on the phase before acceleration. When

As a result, high-dose IVIg at .-.g per kg weight per day for five days was

of the three patients at various time points, and short course of steroids in Patient .
Moreover, in Patient , valsartan, an angiotensin receptor  blocker (ATR), had been
used for treating hypertension. As angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE) has been
identified as the major receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-[, ], there has been
a hypothesis that higher expression of ACE following chronically medication of ATR

Our report is limited by the small numbers of patients we included, and more

evidence is needed to confirm the conclusion. However, it provided an important
therapeutic clue under current situation of rapid disease spreading. The timing of IVIg
administration is very critical in practice. Patients might not receive much benefit when
overall systemic damage has already taken place. Currently, a randomized controlled
