The outbreak of pneumonia of unknown cause that first occurred in Wuhan, China,
December 2019, has recently been assessed by WHO as a pandemic. The pneumonia is
caused by a novel coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2

t

designated coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by WHO. As of March 12, 2020, a
total of 80981 cases had been reported in China, including 3173 reported deaths.
Meanwhile, number of confirmed patients continues to grow out of China and 45309

us

cases had already been reported[1]. The relatively high infectivity, rapid progression of

an

lung involvement, and lack of definite effective treatment, make it urgent to develop

M

efficient measures of management based on the pathogenesis of COVID-19. Although
many empirical therapeutic options have been introduced on several operational

ed

recommendations, including existing and new generation of antivirals, steroids, and
traditional Chinese medicine, the optimal strategy for severe COVID-19 remains

ce
pt

unclear.

The clinical spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection is quite wide, and includes

Ac

asymptomatic infection, mild type with only upper respiratory tract illness, common
type with pulmonary infiltrations, severe type with respiratory distress and critically ill
patients that needs intubation or intensive care[2]. Clinical features of those with
pneumonia include fever, cough, and in many cases a sudden and accelerating
respiratory distress originated from interstitial pneumonia. In those who rapidly
progressed to critical conditions, reduced peripheral lymphocyte counts and elevated
inflammatory factors were observed, indicating an overwhelming immune response[3,

dysfunction lay on the overall cytokine dysregulation. Similarly, the point when status

On Jan 22, 2020, a 56-year-old man was admitted to Jin Yin-tan Hospital, Wuhan, China.
Patient had sore throat since Jan 19, and reported fever for two days before admission,

with the highest temperature of 38.2 degrees Celsius. He was given oseltamivir and
azithromycin by a local clinic to empirically cover community-acquired respiratory

pathogens, yet without any improvement. On Jan 21, he came to the Emergency
Department of Jin Yin-tan Hospital, and a CT scan was done showing scattered

interstitial patches and pleural thickening on the right side (Figure 1). Oropharyngeal
swab was positive for SARS-COV2 by real-time reverse-transcriptase–polymerasechain-reaction (rRT-PCR) assay. He was previously generally healthy, and denied any
exposure or direct contact with the Huanan seafood market.
On admission, he was afebrile, with the blood pressure 125/80mmHg, pulse 86
beats per minute, respiratory rate 20 breaths per minute, and oxygen saturation 96%
when breathing ambient air. Both lungs were clear on auscultation, and the remainder

for Influenza A and B, as well as for H7 subtype avian influenza virus.

The patient was diagnosed COVID-19, common type. Supportive care and

The diagnosis was modified to COVID-19, severe type. High-dose IVIg was started

infusion, patient became afebrile. No adverse event was reported. Over the next few
days, his clinical status gradually improved. The supplemental oxygen was
discontinued, and his oxygen saturation level returned to 97 to 98% on Feb 3 at ambient
air. Test results on Feb 5 showed recovered lymphocyte count to 1.6×109/L. The ESR
decreased to 31mm/h, and hsCRP returned to normal range. The CT scan showed partial
resolution of previous lesions (Figure 1A). Two consecutive oropharyngeal swabs on
Feb 2 and 3 were both negative for 2019-nCoV. Patient was discharged on Feb 5.

Discussion

Although confirmed cases of COVID-19 rapidly accumulated during the past two

Ac

months, our understanding of the clinical spectrum and pathophysiological changes of
this infection still remains very limited. Nevertheless, no definite treatment has been
identified, which makes it extremely difficult for clinical management. Here we report
a case series of COVID-19, all of whom were successfully treated by high-dose IVIg at
the early stage of clinical deterioration. Based on these observations, a high-dose IVIg
administered at the appropriate point, could successfully block the progression of
disease cascade, and finally improve the outcome of COVID-19.

reduction of lymphocyte counts to 0.6×109/L, and elevation of hsCRP to 69.5mg/L

The natural history of SARS-CoV-2 infection does not simply resemble any of the
previously known coronaviruses. Up to date, we have noticed quite a wide clinical
spectrum of SARS-CoV-2 infection, including asymptomatic infection, mild upper

cr
ip

t

reported symptomatic cases including our patients and many others, followed a similar
track of progression. The infection often started with mild or moderate unspecific
symptoms, including but is not limited to low-grade fever, sore throat, coughing, fatigue

us

and malaise, similar to that of a common cold. The initial symptoms would alleviate or

an

persist for around 3-7 days, when high-grade fever developed and respiratory distress

M

became quite prominent. Some of these patients would also have gastrointestinal
symptoms during this period. However, if we look at the CT series as shown here, which

ed

were quite typical of most COVID-19 patients, we would have a very strong impression
that most of the lesions started from the peripheral, especially the subpleural region

ce
pt

when ARDS developed[5]. These features indicated an hematogenous or lymphatic
distribution or spreading of pathogenic factors rather than direct inspiration.

Ac

Based on these observations, we deduced that symptomatic COVID-19 mainly

consists of three phases, including a starting phase, spanning the acquisition of the virus
and subsequent viremia; and in many but not all patients an accelerating phase, when
virus-induced secondary damage of targeting organs and tissue occurs, including the
lungs, the heart, the gastrointestinal tract, and even an overall inflammatory storm. The
third phase is the final recovery phase. This was demonstrated by not only the clinical
features but also the laboratory dynamics, including progressive lymphocytopenia and

elevated inflammation markers at the time of acceleration. Therefore, strategies against
COVID-19 should also be specified according to the course of infection. The best
timing of antivirals, if there are any, may lie on the phase before acceleration. When

an

As a result, high-dose IVIg at 0.3-0.5g per kg weight per day for five days was

M

used in our patients as a potent and safe immune modulator. Dose of IVIg was
determined based on the well-established practice in immune modulation therapy for

ed

other diseases, including the neuromuscular disorders, autoimmune thrombocytopenic
purpura, et al[6, 7], with a consideration of potential cardiac or renal impairment in

severe COVID-19 patients. None of the three patients reported any adverse events. All
patients were clinically improved shortly following the administration, with the

temperature back to normal in one to two days, and breathing difficulties alleviating in
3-5 days. Confounding factors did exist, including the use of different antivirals in two
of the three patients at various time points, and short course of steroids in Patient 3.
Moreover, in Patient 2, valsartan, an angiotensin receptor 1 blocker (AT1R), had been
used for treating hypertension. As angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) has been
identified as the major receptor binding domain of SARS-CoV-2[8, 9], there has been
a hypothesis that higher expression of ACE2 following chronically medication of AT1R

IVIg is a blood product containing polyclonal immunoglobulin G isolated and

preparation, it contains a large number of bioactive moieties, and the entirety of effects

is not yet fully understood. IVIg of higher dose has been a choice of immunomodulatory

an

therapy for autoimmune or inflammatory disease, and for prophylaxis and treatment of

M

severe infections especially in immunocompromised patients[11, 12]. Several theories
have been proposed to explain its potential immunomodulatory mechanisms, including

ed

the Fc-mediated and Fab-mediated approaches[13, 14]. In previous studies of SARS
and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), IVIg therapy has exhibited various

clinical benefits with good tolerance [15-17]. Considering its efficacy in improving
passive immunity and modulating immune inflammation, and the overall safety profile,

high-dose IVIg could be considered a promising option at the early stage of clinical
deterioration of patents with COVID-19.
Our report is limited by the small numbers of patients we included, and more

evidence is needed to confirm the conclusion. However, it provided an important
therapeutic clue under current situation of rapid disease spreading. The timing of IVIg
administration is very critical in practice. Patients might not receive much benefit when
overall systemic damage has already taken place. Currently, a randomized controlled
