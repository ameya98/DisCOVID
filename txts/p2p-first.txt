Summary

Background Coronavirus disease  (COVID-) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-), first detected in China in December, . In January, , state, local, and federal
public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID- in Illinois, USA.
Methods Patients with confirmed COVID- were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV- test. Contacts were
people with exposure to a patient with COVID- on or after the patient’s symptom onset date. Contacts underwent
active symptom monitoring for  days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or
shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-. A convenience sample of
 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested.
Findings Patient —a woman in her s—returned from China in mid-January, . One week later, she was
hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-. Her husband (Patient ) did not travel but had
frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted  days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-. Overall,
 contacts of both cases were identified;  underwent active symptom monitoring, including  community
contacts and  health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts,  became persons under investigation, in addition to
Patient . These  persons under investigation and all  asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for
SARS-CoV-.
Interpretation Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV- occurred between two people with prolonged,
unprotected exposure while Patient  was symptomatic. Despite active symptom monitoring and testing of
symptomatic and some asymptomatic contacts, no further transmission was detected.

Introduction
In January, , a novel virus, severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-), was iden­tified as
the causative agent for a cluster of pneumonia cases
initially detected in Wuhan City, Hubei province, China.
SARS-CoV-, which causes the disease now named
coronavirus disease  (COVID-), had spread
throughout China and to  additional countries as of
Feb , . Phylogenetic data implicate a zoonotic
origin, and the rapid spread suggests ongoing personto-person transmission. Several studies offer additional
insight into person-to-person transmission.– However,
substantial knowledge gaps remain regarding the
transmissibility between humans, including the level of
exposure to a confirmed case at which transmission is
more likely to occur.
On Jan , , Illinois, USA, reported the state’s first
laboratory-confirmed case (index case) of COVID- in a
traveller who returned from Wuhan in mid-January, .
Subsequently, the first evidence of secondary transmission

in the USA was reported on Jan , when the husband
of the index patient, who had not travelled outside
the USA, tested positive for SARS-CoV-. Public health
authorities did an intensive epidemiological investigation
of the two confirmed cases.
This Article describes the first person-to-person
transmission of COVID- in the USA, including the
clinical and laboratory features of both patients and the
assessment and monitoring of several hundred indivi­
duals with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-.

Methods

Epidemiological investigation
The Illinois Department of Public Health, Chicago
Department of Public Health, Cook County Department
of Public Health, and DuPage County Health Department
consulted with the US Centers for Disease Control and
Prevention (CDC) for technical assistance and invited a
CDC field team to assist with onsite investigations after
laboratory confirmation of the first case of COVID-.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed for articles published between database
inception and Feb , , describing transmission of severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-) using
the search terms “severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus ”, “SARS-CoV-”, “novel coronavirus”,
“-nCoV”, or “COVID-”; and “transmission”, “person-toperson”, or “human-to-human”. We found  articles, of which
 were primary reports of person-to-person transmission.
None provided full details of the contact investigation and
none were from North America.
Added value of this study
We detail prolonged, unprotected contact between a travelrelated index case who was symptomatic and her husband,
who subsequently acquired infection. This represents the first
known person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV- in
the USA. We also detail a thorough contact investigation

Patients with COVID- were defined as individuals
with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV- infection. Con­
tacts were defined as people who reported or were
identified to have potential exposure to a case on or after
the day of symptom onset of the case (table ). The earliest
reported day with new symptoms was used as date of
symptom onset. The date of symptom onset for the index
case is considered day  for the purposes of this
investigation, and all subsequent dates will be described
by day of investigation (DOI), starting with DOI . In this
Article, the numbers of contacts exposed to either case
on or after the day of their first positive laboratory result
are also presented.
Patients with COVID- were interviewed using a
standardised questionnaire to identify symptom history,
locations visited while symptomatic, and individuals
with whom they had contact while symptomatic. The
Illinois COVID- Investigation Team, comprised of
local and state public health staff and the CDC field team,
worked with locations visited (eg, workplaces, retail
establishments, or health-care facilities) by patients with
COVID- to identify additional individuals who might
have had exposures to SARS-CoV-. To identify possible
exposures in health-care personnel, patient logs and
staffing records were obtained and reviewed for all
health-care settings visited by patients with COVID-.
Security footage was reviewed to identify additional
health-care personnel and patients who had contact
with patients with COVID- during transport through
the admitting hospital. Health-care personnel were
defined as all people working in health-care settings
who had the potential for exposure to infectious
materials, including members of the Illinois COVID-
Investigation Team. All other contacts were classified as
community members, including patients in the same

related to these cases. We identified, risk-stratified, and actively
monitored almost  contacts of both cases.  contacts
developed symptoms of fever, cough, or shortness of breath in
the  days following their last exposure to either case and
were tested for SARS-CoV-, and  asymptomatic health-care
professional contacts who had exposures across a range of risk
levels were also tested for SARS-CoV-. All  tested negative.
Implications of all the available evidence
Person-to-person transmission of SARS-CoV- occurred
between two people with prolonged, unprotected exposure.
No further transmission was detected, despite monitoring
contacts for symptoms and testing all who developed fever,
cough, or shortness of breath and testing a convenience sample
of asymptomatic health-care professional contacts. Further
detailed reports of contact investigations associated with cases
of SARS-CoV- could improve understanding of the
transmissibility of this novel virus.

indoor environment in a health-care setting (eg, a
hospital waiting room).

Exposure risk classification
Health-care personnel and community members with
potential exposure to SARS-CoV- were interviewed using
standardised contact questionnaires to assess exposure
and whether the individual had true contact with a patient
with COVID-. Exposure risk was classified according
to frameworks designed by members of the Illinois
COVID- Investigation Team in consultation with CDC
subject-matter experts (table ). These frameworks were
based on published guidance for Middle East respiratory
syndrome coronavirus and designed and implemented
before interim risk assessment guidance for COVID-
released by CDC.,

Active monitoring of contacts
All health-care personnel and community contacts
assessed to have had low-risk, medium-risk, mediumhigh-risk, or high-risk exposures were enrolled in active
symptom monitoring, which continued for  days after
last exposure to a patient with COVID-. Active symp­
tom monitoring was done using Research Electronic
Data Capture software (Vanderbilt University, Nashville,
TN). Contacts received automated, twice-daily emails
inquiring about symptoms, including cough and
shortness of breath, and a request for a self-measured
temperature. If symptoms or fever (temperature of >°C)
were reported, or if contacts did not respond or declined
email monitoring, public health officials telephoned
contacts daily. For hospital-based health-care personnel
not excluded from work, pre-shift symptom assessment
for fever, cough, or shortness of breath was implemented
by hospital occupational health services. To identify any

room), or being in a shared air space vacated by a confirmed case within the previous  h. Transient interactions, such as walking by confirmed case, were not considered close contact. Of note, nasopharyngeal and

Jan , , before published guidance from CDC for COVID-. Criteria were based on published MERS-CoV guidance and additional input from CDC and state and local health officials. The medium-high-risk
classification was included owing to the identification of some community contacts who did not meet the highest category of exposure risk but were nevertheless concerning.

 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts had
one-time nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens
obtained at least  days from their highest-risk expo­
sure. All health-care personnel contacts were offered
testing, but laboratory capacity and availability of healthcare personnel to undergo testing were limited in the
setting of this urgent investigation. Before Patient 
reported symptoms to public health investigators,
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal swabs were also
collected from Patient  owing to his high-risk exposures
to Patient .
Specimens were collected per CDC guidance. All
specimens were refrigerated at –°C before shipping on
icepacks to CDC. CDC did real-time RT-PCR (rtPCR) to
detect three separate genetic markers of SARS-CoV-,
as previously described. The cycle threshold value
ranges for the three markers were interpreted as a semiquanti­tative measure of the RNA concentration in the
specimen.

Results
Patient  is a female in her s who travelled to Wuhan
on Dec , , and returned to Illinois on Jan , ,
and who was not symptomatic while travelling. In
Wuhan, she visited a hospitalised relative regularly and
visited other family members who had undiagnosed
respiratory illnesses, one of whom was later hospitalised
with viral pneumonia. No contacts had laboratoryconfirmed COVID-, but it is unknown whether any
were tested for SARS-CoV-.
On DOI , she sought care at an outpatient clinic for
fever, fatigue, and cough and was hospitalised that day for
pneumonia. She was reported to public health authorities
as a PUI on DOI . Retrospectively, she reported that her
symptoms, which also included nausea, abdominal
discomfort, and dizziness, started as early as  days before
admission (figure).

Before hospitalisation, she had frequent, close con­
tact with her husband on DOI – when she had an
active cough. Her husband had not travelled to Wuhan.
She and her husband live together, eat together, share
a bed, and have frequent face-to-face interactions.
Facemasks or other personal protective equipment
(PPE) were not used at the home. Her husband was
classified as having high-risk exposures and began
active symptom monitoring on DOI  with specimen
collection on DOI , before his report of any new
symptoms.
Patient  has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease,
with a chronic, productive cough and baseline dyspnoea;
therefore, the timing of symptom onset related to
COVID- was difficult to determine (figure). When first
interviewed as a contact on DOI , he reported no fever
or change in chronic respiratory symptoms. Later, he
reported increased dyspnoea and sputum production
starting on DOI , which was also the first day of
specimen collection as a contact in Patient ’s investi­
gation. Upon further interview of Patient ’s contacts, it
was suggested that some non-specific symptoms might
have started as early as DOI , with fatigue and worsening
cough. On DOI , he reported new haemoptysis and
worsening dyspnoea through active monitoring. He was
promptly admitted to the hospital and placed in an
airborne infection isolation room (AIIR). Nasopharyngeal
and oropharyngeal specimens from DOI  tested positive
for SARS-CoV- on DOI .
On hospital admission, vital signs, and physical
examination for Patient  were within normal limits. Her
chest radiograph demonstrated no abnormalities, but a
CT scan of her chest revealed bilateral multifocal

infiltrates and mediastinal and hilar lymphadenopathy.
On admission, Patient  had mild tachypnoea and coarse
breath sounds with mild wheezes bilaterally, although
whether these signs represented a change from his
baseline status is unclear. Patient ’s chest radiograph
showed emphysematous changes and right lower lobe
infiltrates consistent with pneumonia. For both patients,
testing for other viral and bacterial respiratory infec­­
tions was negative. Both experienced mild leukopenia
(Patient  white blood count nadir · × ³ cells per μL,
Patient  nadir · × ³ cells per μL), lympho­
penia
(Patient  absolute lymphocyte count nadir · × ³ cells
per μL, Patient  nadir · × ³ cells per μL), and
mild elevations in aspartate aminotransferase and
alanine aminotransferase (Patient  peak  units per L
and  units per L, Patient  peak  units per L and
 units per L). No other remarkable laboratory results
were noted.
Both patients recovered and were discharged to home
isolation on DOI . Hospital admission was extended
while arrangements were made for home isolation.

Patient  wore a facemask in the emergency department
waiting room and was placed on droplet precautions in
the emergency department and for the first  h after
admission. She was subsequently transferred to an AIIR,

room were required to adhere to Standard, Contact, and
Airborne Precautions, including hand hygiene, gloves,
gown, respirator, and eye protection. Health-care per­

and admitted to an AIIR and placed on TransmissionBased Precautions as described for Patient .
For Patient , initial nasopharyngeal, oropharyngeal, and

whereas serum and urine were negative. Her initial
sputum rtPCR cycle threshold values ranged between

Sputum specimens remained positive longer than all other

 contacts of either Patient  or Patient  were
identified. Public health investigators were able to
assess exposure risk and actively monitor symptoms
for  (%) of the  contacts, including  (%) of
 contacts with exposure on or after the date of first
positive specimen collection. There were  people that
had insufficient contact information to complete active
monitoring. None of these individuals were found to
have emergency department visits with fever, cough, or
shortness of breath using near real-time surveillance
data received from regional acute care hospitals for
 days after their last exposure. Data presented are
for those actively monitored. Of these  contacts,
 (%) were health-care personnel and  (%)
were community members. Although the majority of
monitored contacts ( [%] of ) had low-risk
exposures,  (%) had exposures of medium risk or
greater (table ).
Although Patient  and  live together and were
hospitalised in the same facility, and therefore shared
several common contacts ( shared community contacts
from emergency department or outpatient waiting rooms
and  health-care personnel who interacted with both
patients), they also had many unique contacts. Patient 
had  unique health-care personnel contacts and
 unique community contacts, including one household
contact (Patient ). Patient  had  unique health-care
personnel contacts and  unique community contacts,
including  from outpatient waiting rooms.
The majority of contacts ( [%] of  total moni­
tored contacts and  [%] of  monitored contacts
on or after the date of first positive specimen collection)
did not develop symptoms consistent with PUI criteria.
Additionally, surveillance data from Illinois acute care
hospitals indicated that no asymptomatic monitored
contacts or other contacts who could not be reached for
active symptom monitoring presented to an emergency
department with fever, cough, or shortness of breath
during DOI –.
During active symptom monitoring,  (%) of
 total contacts became PUIs, including  (%) of
	

 monitored contacts who had exposures on or after the
date of first positive specimen collection.
As a household contact, Patient  was the only commu­
nity member who had a high-risk exposure. He became
a PUI and subsequently the only other patient with
COVID- in this investigation. Of the remaining  PUIs,
all tested negative for SARS-CoV- while symptomatic;
 of these PUIs were health-care personnel and  were
community contacts. Although  (%) of  PUIs had
low-risk exposures,  (%) had exposures of medium
risk or greater.
 health-care personnel contacts who were not
PUIs had one-time nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal
specimens collected – days after their highest-risk
exposure. All of these exposures occurred on or after the
date of first positive specimen collection of a patient with

personnel had exposures of medium risk or greater. All
were negative for SARS-CoV- at the time of testing.

Discussion
This Article documents the first known person-to-person
transmission of SARS-CoV- in the USA. Transmission
occurred between close household contacts, from an index
travel-associated case who subsequently transmitted the
infection to her husband. Their prolonged, unprotected
close contact occurred across multiple days early in her
illness, before Patient  sought clinical care. No add­
itional cases of COVID- were identified through active
symptom monitoring of several hundred community and
health-care personnel contacts, testing of symptomatic
PUIs, or screening of a subset of asymptomatic healthcare personnel contacts. These data suggest that personto-person transmission of COVID- might be most likely
to occur through unprotected, prolonged exposure to a
patient with symptomatic COVID-. Our experience of
limited transmission of SARS-CoV- differs from that
documented in Wuhan, where transmission has been
reported to occur across the wider community and in
health-care personnel, and from experiences of other
similar coronaviruses.– The severity of illness, the extent
of viral shedding, and timing of exposures to a symp­
tomatic patient might all have contributed to the limited
transmission described here. Infection control measures
within the hospital setting and an aggressive public health
response might also have prevented further exposures.
Much like the first US case of COVID- in Washington,
both Illinois patients had mild-to-moderate illnesses that
started with non-specific symptoms, making early iden­
tification difficult for patients, clinicians, and public
health investigators. Furthermore, Patient ’s baseline
cough and dyspnoea made iden­
tifying new symptoms
challenging. These factors have implications for detection
of future cases. Clinicians and public health officials
should maintain a low threshold for testing in patients
with comorbidities that might obscure obvious signs and
symptoms of COVID-.

The timing and duration of viral shedding after
SARS-CoV- infection is unknown. In the two Illinois
patients, sputum specimens remained rtPCR-positive
longer than other specimen types. Recognising that rtPCR
testing detects any SARS-CoV- RNA, not necessarily
infectious virus, further studies are needed to understand
how viral shedding and detection are associated with
transmission. Such studies have implications for public
health recommendations regarding the type and duration
of isolation required for patients with COVID- and will
allow for more focused and targeted contact tracing and
testing of appropriate specimens based on duration of
illness.
These data are preliminary and subject to several
limitations. First, this Article describes only one known
transmission event and the associated contact investi­
gation. Findings might not be generalisable or repre­
sentative of broader transmission patterns. Second, this
investigation might not have identified all individuals
with potential exposure to SARS-CoV-, because epi­
demio­logical investigations are dependent on individuals’
recall of places visited, people seen, and symptom onset.
The date of symptom onset for Patient  was especially
difficult to ascertain. Given this uncertainty, we applied a
conservative approach for identifying contacts of Patient 
by using the earliest reported date of possible symptom
onset, DOI . This could have artificially increased the
number of contacts and provided false reassurance of
infrequent transmission. Therefore, we also present data
separately for exposures that occurred on or after the first
known date of viral positivity.
Third, this investigation took place before published
CDC guidance for classifying exposure risk among
contacts of patients with COVID-., The risk classi­
fication used here differed from the now published
guidance in some key areas. For example, we considered
nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimen collection
aerosol-generating procedures, and therefore classified
health-care personnel performing these without all
recommended PPE as high risk, whereas they are
classified as medium risk according to the guidance.
Additionally, we included community members as
contacts if they entered the same indoor environment
(eg, hospital waiting room) within  h of a patient with
COVID-, an approach based on other viruses with
airborne transmission patterns, such as measles. Current
interim guidance requires contacts to have been in the
room at the same time as a patient with COVID-.
Therefore, the risk stratifications used here might not be
comparable to future investigations using this guidance.
Fourth, nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens
collected on both PUIs and asymptomatic health-care
personnel contacts were collected at a single timepoint;
a single negative SARS-CoV- rtPCR might not be
sufficient to definitively rule out infection over a -day
incubation period, and only a convenience sample of a
minority of health-care personnel contacts were tested in

this study, albeit weighted to capture those with higherrisk exposures. Additionally, the active symptom moni­
toring employed here would not detect asymptomatic
transmission. Future serological studies of exposed
contacts will allow a better understanding of asymp­
tomatic infection rates. Furthermore, updated CDC
guidance recommends including sore throat as a
possible symptom of COVID- when evaluating healthcare personnel, whereas in this investigation, only
those with fever, cough, or shortness of breath were
tested for SARS-CoV-.
Nevertheless, our ongoing investigation has only
detected transmission of SARS-CoV- in a single house­
hold contact with frequent, prolonged interactions with
the index patient. The absence of COVID- among healthcare personnel supports recommendations regarding
appropriate infection control. These findings also support
CDC’s assessment that, without using appropriate PPE,
people living in the same household as, or providing care
in a non-health-care setting for, a person with symptomatic
laboratory-confirmed COVID- have high-risk exposure.
In these contexts, CDC’s recommendation for people with
high-risk exposures to remain quarantined with no public
activities might be effective in reducing onward person-toperson transmission of SARS-CoV-. Given the difficulty
in detecting new symptoms in patients with underlying
lung disease, CDC recommends that clinicians consi­
dering a diagnosis of COVID- should discuss testing
with public health departments on a case-by-case basis.
Patients with potential exposure to SARS-CoV- with a
fever, cough, or shortness of breath should call their
health-care provider before seeking care so that appro­
priate preventive actions can be implemented. Healthcare facilities should rapidly triage and isolate suspected
PUIs and notify infection prevention services and local
health departments for support in testing, management,
and containment efforts.
