Summary

Background On Dec , , China reported a cluster of cases of pneumonia in people at Wuhan, Hubei Province.
The responsible pathogen is a novel coronavirus, named severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 
(SARS-CoV-). We report the relevant features of the first cases in Europe of confirmed infection, named coronavirus
disease  (COVID-), with the first patient diagnosed with the disease on Jan , .
Methods In this case series, we followed five patients admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (Paris,
France) and Pellegrin University Hospital (Bordeaux, France) and diagnosed with COVID- by semi-quantitative
RT-PCR on nasopharyngeal swabs. We assessed patterns of clinical disease and viral load from different samples
(nasopharyngeal and blood, urine, and stool samples), which were obtained once daily for  days from hospital admission,
and once every  or  days until patient discharge. All samples were refrigerated and shipped to laboratories in the
National Reference Center for Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon,
France), where RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR, and virus isolation and titration procedures were done.
Findings The patients were three men (aged  years,  years, and  years) and two women (aged  years and
 years), all of Chinese origin, who had travelled to France from China around mid-January, . Three different
clinical evolutions are described: () two paucisymptomatic women diagnosed within a day of exhibiting symptoms,
with high nasopharyngeal titres of SARS-CoV- within the first  h of the illness onset (· and · log copies per
 cells, respectively) and viral RNA detection in stools; () a two-step disease progression in two young men,
with a secondary worsening around  days after disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal
samples; and () an -year-old man with a rapid evolution towards multiple organ failure and a persistent high
viral load in lower and upper respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus detection in plasma. The
-year-old patient died on day  of illness (Feb , ); all other patients had recovered and been discharged by
Feb , .
Interpretation We illustrated three different clinical and biological types of evolution in five patients infected with
SARS-CoV- with detailed and comprehensive viral sampling strategy. We believe that these findings will contribute
to a better understanding of the natural history of the disease and will contribute to advances in the implementation
of more efficient infection control strategies.

Introduction
The coronavirus disease  (COVID-) epidemic
spread within China, and secondarily also outside
China, with a basic reproductive number estimated to
be from · to · and a mortality rate of around
·%. In the EU (and European Economic Area) and
the UK, as of March , ,  cases have been
reported ( in France), including  deaths (seven in
France).
So far, several studies have described demographic,
clinical, and biological characteristics of patients
with COVID-, and radiological or pathological findings
associated with COVID-. More specifically, these studies
have reported the most common symp­toms, incubation

periods, biological abnormalities, radio­
graphic abnor­
malities, CT abnormalities, and treatment data. In
addition, they have described varying degrees of illness
and their severity: mild, severe, or critical. They have
reported proportion of complications, including acute
respiratory distress syndrome, or case fatality rates, and
variables associated with these complications and death.,–
In this Article, through a detailed and comprehensive
sampling strategy, we report the clinical and biological
features of the first five cases of confirmed COVID- in
Europe, which occurred in France, and their dynamics in
parallel with changes in their viral load, based on severe
acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-)
RNA detection.

Research in context
Evidence before this study
We searched PubMed Central for all studies or reports presenting
clinical characteristics of patients with coronavirus disease 
(COVID-), using the terms “COVID-” and “clinical” or
“-nCoV” and “clinical” from database inception to
Feb , . No language restrictions were applied. Our search
returned  publications. These papers described demographic,
clinical, and biological characteristics of patients with COVID-,
and radiological or pathological findings associated with,
COVID-. In particular, they reported most common symptoms,
incubation periods, biological abnormalities, radiographic
abnormalities, CT abnormalities, and treatment data. They also
described varying degrees of illness and their severity: mild,
severe, or critical. They reported proportion of complications,
including acute respiratory distress syndrome, or case fatality
rates and variables associated with these complications and
death. In addition, these studies reported data on virus shedding.
They studied in particular dynamics of the viral load in sputum,
urine, throat swab, and stool samples in symptomatic and
asymptomatic individuals. They also evaluated virus shedding in
patients who had recovered.
Added value of this study
This study reports clinical data from the first patients diagnosed
with COVID- in Europe. The study also brings to the field
some new and original findings by including patients at
different stages of infection (ie, at very early stages or later in
the course of the disease) and through a detailed and
comprehensive sampling strategy; patients enrolled early being
contacts of patients enrolled later during the course of the
disease. To our knowledge, the association between clinical
evolution and the virological dynamic has not been reported in
the past. It allowed us to describe three patterns:

This case series is part of an overall French clinical
cohort assessing patients with COVID- (NCT).
All patients at French hospitals who were diagnosed
with COVID- according to the French National Health
Agency criteria were enrolled in this cohort from
Jan  to Jan , .
Together with the French National Regulatory
authorities and French Ministry of Health, on
Jan , , we determined the indication criteria for
compassionate use of an investigational antiviral
treatment (remdesivir) as signs of severe illness at
diagnosis or secondary clinical aggravation (respiratory
symptoms or general signs) based on WHO criteria for
severe pneumonia caused by SARS-CoV- (appendix
p ). On the basis of expert opinion and available data
in January, , we considered that remdesivir might
be the best potential drug for the treatment of
COVID-, although restricted to patients with severe
disease (intravenous route, a loading dose of  mg,

paucisymptomatic patients diagnosed very quickly over their
disease course, with an early high nasopharyngeal shedding of
severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-)
within the first  h of the illness onset (· and · log copies
per  cells, respectively); patients with a two-step disease
progression, with a secondary worsening around  days after
disease onset despite a decreasing viral load in nasopharyngeal
samples; and a patient with a rapid evolution towards multiple
organ failure and a persistent high viral load in lower and upper
respiratory tract with systemic virus dissemination and virus
detection in plasma (ie, an old patient).
Implications of all the available evidence
Paucisymptomatic patients, because of high viral loads in upper
respiratory tract samples, might potentially transmit the
disease during the very first days of symptoms despite having a
mild presentation of the disease. The implication is that
COVID- control measures should combine immediate
isolation of cases after symptom onset together with a rapid
screening and monitoring of the contacts of infected patients.
In patients with severe disease, two patterns were identified.
The first pattern was a biphasic evolution starting with a mild
presentation followed by a secondary respiratory worsening
despite a decreasing viral load in the nasopharyngeal samples,
suggesting that the lung damage at this phase is more related
to immunopathological lesions. The second pattern, observed
in the most severely ill patient who died, was a persistent and
high viral excretion in the upper respiratory tract samples
combined with a positive virus detection in other body fluids
including blood. These findings will contribute to better
understanding of the natural history of the disease and in
tailoring treatment strategies.

then maintenance daily dose of  mg for a total
duration of  days). Criteria for discharge with total
recovery were from European Centre for Disease Pre­
vention and Control guidelines: asymptomatic patients
with two RT-PCR negative naso­pharyngeal samples at
least  h apart.
The five patients in this case series, at different stages of
infection, include two patients with a mild disease at
admission and a secondary worsening that resulted in
their admission to an intensive care unit (ICU), one initially
severely ill patient directly admitted to an ICU for an acute
respiratory failure, and two patients with a mild disease
diagnosed very early after infection.
We used the open-access Clinical Characterization
Protocol for Severe Emerging Infections of the
International Severe Acute Respiratory and Emerging
Infection Consortium, supported by WHO, which has
been updated in response to COVID-. This study was
approved by the French Ethics Committee, and written
informed consent was obtained from each patient
involved or their next of kin.

Procedures
Clinical samples for SARS-CoV- diagnostic testing were
obtained according to WHO guidelines. For each
patient, a sampling strategy was implemented in which
samples were obtained once daily for  days from hospital
admis­sion, and subsequently once every  or  days until
patient discharge or death. Upper and lower (when
possible) respiratory tract samples, and also blood, urine,
and stool samples (or rectal swabs, if appropriate) were
obtained. Upper respiratory samples were either
nasopharyngeal aspirates or nasopharyngeal swabs
(Sigma Virocult, Medical Wire Instrument, Corsham,
UK), stool samples were either faecal swabs or stools,
and blood samples were EDTA tube adapted for RT-PCR.
All samples were refrigerated and shipped to the
laboratories of the National Reference Center for
Respiratory Viruses (The Institut Pasteur, Paris, and
Hospices Civils de Lyon, Lyon, France), where procedures
for RNA extraction, real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR), and
virus isolation and titration were undertaken. RNA

extraction was done with the Extraction NucleoSpin Dx
Virus kit (Macherey Nagel, Düren, Germany) or by the
automated NucliSENS easyMAG (bioMérieux, Marcyl’Étoile, France), using the manufacturers’ instructions.
RdRp-IP and RdRp quantitative rtRT-PCR (appendix p )
was used for detection of SARS-CoV-. The RdRp RT-PCR
corresponds to the Charité protocol. When a sample
(respiratory samples, plasma, or stool) was positive with
RdRp-IP, quantification of the number of RNA copies
was done according to a scale ranging from ³ to ⁶
copies per μL. The viral load in stools was calculated as
previously described and expressed in number of RNA
copies per g of stool. The quality of nasopharyngeal
swabs was checked using the CELL Control r-gene kit
(bioMérieux). This kit is provided with quantified
plasmid for cellular quantification. All viral loads for
respiratory samples were calculated with the same
method as for stools and normalised according to the
cellular quantification as the number of RNA copies per
 cells. All positive plasma samples were quantified

Results
The main clinical and biological characteristics of the five
patients at hospital admission are presented in table . All
patients but patient  were diagnosed with COVID- on
the day of their hospital admission. Patient  was diagnosed
 days after because he did not fulfil the National Health
Agency case definition at admission (no history of travel to
or residence in the city of Wuhan). On Feb , , all
patients except patient  had fully recovered and were
discharged. Patient  died on Feb , .
Schematic presentation of major events for each case
are presented in figure . Clinical and biological
characteristics day by day for each case are presented in
the appendix (pp –).
Patients  and  had mild disease at admission and
secondarily severe disease, following the definition of the
	

Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention.
Patient  was a -year-old Chinese male tourist from
Wuhan who was admitted to Bichat-Claude Bernard
University Hospital (Paris, France). He was diagnosed
with COVID- on Jan ,  (illness day ),  days after
his arrival in Paris with his wife (patient ). He visited a
hospital in Wuhan on Jan  for a gout episode. He had
influenza-like symptoms (table ) from Jan  (illness
day ), and was admitted to hospital on the day of the
diagnosis with mild lymphopenia, thrombopenia, and no
abnormalities on the chest x-ray. On illness day , he was
transferred to an ICU because of worsening of oxygen
saturation (PO= mm Hg; flow nasal cannula  L/min),
and bilateral lung abnormalities including ground-glass
opacities, reticulo-nodular syndrome, and alveolar opa­
cities on chest CT scan (appendix p ). A loading dose of
remdesivir was administered on Jan  (illness day ),
followed by maintenance treatment. On Jan , he was
discharged back to the infectious diseases ward. On illness
day , remdesivir treatment was discontinued because of
alanine aminotransferase elevation (levels three times
higher than the upper limit of normal) and a maculopapular
rash, without any anaphylaxis, eosinophilia, or systemic
symptoms. The patient was screened for hepatitis B and C,
cytomegalovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, and herpes simplex
virus, and no active infection was detected. Skin and liver
abnor­malities decreased within  days. The patient became
asymptomatic the following day. He was discharged on
Feb .
Patient  was a -year old man of Chinese origin,
based in France. He travelled for business to China and
flew back from Shanghai to France on Jan , . He
did not report any specific exposures within the  days
before symptom onset except a -day stay at Wuhan.
Arterial hypertension was his only underlying disease.
Influenza-like symptoms started on Jan , and he was
diagnosed on Jan  (illness day ) at Pellegrin University
Hospital and admitted to this hospital. On illness day ,
he was transferred to an ICU with fever of more than
·°C and skin mottling suggesting sepsis. On Jan , a
CT scan showed bilateral lung abnormalities including
ground-glass opacities, reticulo-nodular syndrome, and
scarce alveolar opacities. In the ICU, a loading dose of
remdesivir was administered on Jan  (illness day ),
followed by maintenance treatment until Feb . After full
recovery, he was discharged on Feb .
Patient  had a rapidly progressive disease classified as
critical at diagnosis. Patient  was an -year-old Chinese
male tourist from Yichang (Hubei Province, China) and
was diagnosed with COVID- on Jan ,  (illness
day ),  days after his arrival in Europe with his daughter
(patient ). He did not report any specific exposure within
the  days before symptom onset. He had a thyroid cancer
removed in . He had fever and diarrhoea from Jan ,
and went to the emergency room in another hospital on
Jan , where the chest x-ray showed bilateral alveolar
opacities. He did not fulfil the COVID- case definition.

However, airborne and contact precautions were observed
during his hospital stay before COVID- diagnosis. On
Jan , an acute respiratory failure triggered his ICU
admission to Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital.
He subsequently developed multiple organ failure with
acute respiratory distress syndrome, acute kidney injury,
liver failure, and sepsis-like shock. After the COVID-
diagnosis was confirmed on Jan , he was transferred to
the referent ICU at Bichat-Claude Bernard Hospital in
Paris, where broad-spectrum antibacterials were started
for a possible superinfection. Remdesivir was started with
a loading dose. As two pathogens were identified, a
susceptible Acinetobacter baumannii (multiplex PCR,
confirmed by tracheal aspirates culture) and an Aspergillus
flavus (tracheal aspirates culture), the anti-infective
treatment was adapted. We treated A baumanii with
meropenem, tigecycline, and colimycin followed by
meropenem and levofloxacin. We initially treated A flavus
with voriconazole but switched to isavuconazole because
voriconazole and remdesivir both contain sulphobutyletherβ-cyclodextrin, and the safety of this association has not
been evaluated yet. Remdesivir was discon­tinued on Jan 
because the patient needed renal replacement therapy. CT
scan on Jan  showed a bilateral pleuropneumopathy
including pleural effusion, alveolar condensations,
ground-glass opacities, and pulmonary cysts. On Feb ,
because of the severity of the disease and persistence of
viral detection, and as the risk–benefit assessment was
considered favourable, remdesivir was reinitiated. Multiple
organ failure persisted despite appropriate treatment
against A baumannii and A flavus and no other
superinfection was identified. The patient died on Feb 
(illness day ).
Patients  and  were admitted to hospital early after the
onset of the symptoms, and were classified as having mild
disease. Patient  (patient ’s wife), a -year-old Chinese
woman, was diagnosed with COVID- on Jan , , at
Bichat-Claude Bernard University Hospital (illness day ),
 days after her arrival in Paris. She had spent those days
with patient . She had moderate influenza-like symptoms
from Jan  (illness day ), with no abnormalities on the
chest x-ray. After some days of persistent and incapacitating

cough, her condition improved without any specific treat­
ment. She became asymptomatic on Feb  (illness day )
and was discharged on Feb .
Patient  (patients ’s daughter), a -year-old Chinese
woman, was diagnosed with COVID- on Jan , 
(illness day ). She had stayed with patient  since their
travel from China. She had mild symptoms, with sore
throat and dry cough from Jan  (illness day ), and a
normal chest x-ray. Her cough, which was initially mild,
increased transiently over time; she was asymptomatic
from Feb  (illness day ) without any specific treatment,
and was discharged on Feb .
Patients  and  had nasopharyngeal samples collected
within the first  h of illness onset, allowing an early
diagnosis of COVID-. These early specimens had a high
viral load, enabling whole-genome virus sequencing and
virus isolation (table ). The maximal normalised viral
load obtained in their respiratory specimens were at
· log copies per  cells for patient  and
· log copies per  cells for patient  (based on the
RdRp quantitative rtRT-PCR). This viral load in respiratory
samples decreased over time (figure ). SARS-CoV-
detection by RT-PCR was negative on illness day  for
patient  and on illness day  for patient  (figure ).
These patients also had a positive detection of SARS-CoV-
in stools, with viral load as high as · log copies per g of
stool for patient  and · log copies per g of stool for
patient . However, the virus was not detected in the
serum or the urine samples.
Patient  had nasopharyngeal samples collected at
illness day  and patient  on day , which were positive
by rtRT-PCR, with a SARS-CoV- viral load of
· log copies per  cells, and detected but not
quantifiable viral load, respectively. The whole-genome
virus sequence was obtained by direct sequencing for
patient  only; virus isolation was unsuccessful in both
cases. The secondary evolution to severe disease in these
two patients (days  and ) was not correlated to any
viral load increase (figure ). Both received intravenous
remdesivir when the viral load had already decreased
below the detection threshold. During the whole course
of the disease of these two patients, SARS-CoV-

Discussion
In this case series of five patients with COVID-, we
illustrated three different clinical and biological types of
evolution: first, mild cases through two paucisymptomatic
patients aged younger than  years who were diagnosed
early, with high viral load in nasopharyngeal samples,
suggesting a significant shedding of SARS-CoV-, reflec­
ted by virus detection by RT-PCR; second, two young

detection by RT-PCR was negative in stools, serum, and
urine.
At illness day , patient  (whose disease was classified
as critical) was positive by RT-PCR in both a naso­
pharyngeal sample and bronchoalveolar lavage, with
cycle threshold values for the E gene target (Charité
protocol) of · and ·, and similar cycle threshold
values for the house-keeping gene GAPDH of · and
·, respectively (table ). The SARS-CoV- titres in the
nasopharynx were stable (from · to · log copies per
 cells) over time, although with a trend towards
decrease after the first intravenous remdesivir dose, and
thereafter when remdesivir was reinitiated (figure ).
This patient had a RNAaemia on illness day  and
subsequently, with a low viral load (detected but below
the quantification limit). During the course of the
disease, he developed a pleural exudative effusion, with
SARS-CoV- detection positive in the pleural fluid and
negative bacterial cultures.
Figure  illustrates the kinetics of the viral load in
nasopharyngeal samples of all patients after disease
onset. The viral load decreased over time and became
negative between illness day  and  in four patients
(patients , , , and ). In the most severely ill patient
(patient ), nasopharyngeal virus detection persisted
until death.
When available, the sequence analysis of the virus of
these patients showed that patients  and  compared with
patient  correspond to two distinct events of importation.
For patients  and , the virus was clustering with viruses
from cases in Wuhan, Shenzhen (China), California
(USA), Australia, and Taiwan, whereas for patient  the
virus was clustering with those from Chongqing (China)
and Singapore (the genetic epidemiology of SARS-CoV- is
available online). Furthermore, the very high degree of
identity of the sequences from patients  and  supports
the epidemiological link between these cases and the
likelihood of transmission.

patients presenting with mild symptoms at admission
and experiencing a secondary progression to pneumonia
and severe disease by days –; and third, an older
patient with a rapid evolution towards critical disease
with multiple organ failure and a long and sustained
persistence of SARS-CoV- nasopharyngeal detection
associated with viral RNA detection in multiple sites,
including blood.
Among the five cases investigated here, the two patients
with mild disease were diagnosed at an early stage of the
disease because they had a contact with a confirmed case.
High viral loads in upper respiratory tract samples are
suggestive of potentially high risk of transmissibility
during the very first days of symptoms. This finding is in
line with data reported by Zou and colleagues, who
analysed viral load in the upper respiratory tract in
relation to day of onset of symptoms in  symptomatic
patients in whom higher viral loads were detected soon
after symptom onset. This observation suggests that the
virus shedding pattern of patients infected with
SARS-CoV- is different from that seen with SARS-CoV,
in which the virus load was very low at disease onset.–
These findings might affect the implementation of
infection control measures. The implication is that
COVID- control measures should combine immediate
isolation of patients with the disease together with a

rapid screening and monitoring of the contacts of these
patients to detect those with very mild symptoms. In two
of five patients reported here, SARS-CoV- RNA was
detected in stool samples. This possible route of
transmission must be investigated; detection of viral
RNA does not necessarily imply that infectious particles
are present and transmissible, particularly when
patients, such as these two individuals, have no diarrhoea
or other gastrointestinal symptoms.
In this case series, except for the patient with critical
disease, the viral load decreased over time and became
negative between illness day  and day . Of note, the
virus was also detected by rtRT-PCR at low levels in the
upper respiratory tract, even after full resolution of
symptoms. Whether infectious virus might be still present
despite symptom resolution will require further attempts
of virus isolation. This uncertainty justifies the European
Centre for Disease Prevention and Control recom­
mendation to obtain two RT-PCR negative nasopharyngeal
samples before discharge of asymptomatic patients. This
conservative recommendation is, however, no longer
feasible in many European countries that are in an
epidemic situation.
In this case series, three patients had a severe or
critical disease with two different patterns. The
first one, in patients with severe diseases (patients 
and ), is characterised by a biphasic evolution starting
with a mild presentation followed with a secondary
respiratory worsening despite a decreasing viral load in
the naso­
pharyngeal samples: SARS-CoV- was no
longer detected in the upper respiratory tract in
one patient and at very low levels in the other. In
patients with this pattern, a CT scan at the moment of
the worsening showed ground-glass lung opacities, in
line with those reported by others in patients with
COVID-., Time to worsening of respiratory
symptoms was around  days after disease onset in
these two cases, close to the median disease duration
before worsening (· days [IQR ·–·]), previously
reported by Huang and collaborators. In these
patients, one might postulate that th­e lung damage is
more related to immuno­pathological lesions, resulting
from an excessive pro-inflammatory host response,
rather than to uncontrolled viral replication. Of note,
we did not assess virus load in low respiratory tract
samples from these two patients.
The second pattern, observed in the patient classified as
having critical disease and who died (patient ), consists of
a persistent and high viral excretion in the upper
respiratory tract samples combined with positive virus
detection by rtRT-PCR in other body fluids, including
blood. By contrast with the previous pattern, this persistent
high viral load suggests the ability of the SARS-CoV- to
evade the immune response. Indeed, we can speculate
that, as shown during Middle East respiratory syndrome
(MERS) and SARS coronavirus infections,, SARS-CoV-
might be able to inhibit the interferon signalling
	

pathways, resulting in higher respiratory virus load,
positive viraemia, and eventually poor prognosis, as for
MERS-CoV., Indeed, the -year-old patient, unlike the
other cases, had evidence of high viral replication in
the respiratory tract and evidence for systemic virus
dissemination beyond the respiratory tract, with virus
detection in plasma and pleural effusion fluid. The
impaired immune response might have facilitated the
bacterial and fungal superinfections. Patients with similar,
severe patterns (sustained viral RNA in the respiratory
tract and detection of SARS-CoV- in the blood) have also
been reported in China. As reported in previous
studies,, severely ill patients are often older patient with
comorbidities. Patient  was aged  years and might have
had an impaired interferon pathway.
These different patterns, and especially the fact that
patients with severe or critical disease might have
different viral kinetics in the upper respiratory tract,
might be important. The findings suggest that different
therapeutic approaches, based on viral kinetics
monitoring, might be needed in patients with a virus
load decrease in the upper respiratory tract versus those
with high viral replication and systemic virus
dissemination. We should be cautious when analysing
these data because of the small number of patients, but
adapting treatment to the clinical course should be
considered in future studies.
There is no currently validated antiviral treatment to
control such SARS-CoV- infections. Among potential
candidates, remdesivir is an antiviral prodrug (nucleosidic
analogue family) that has broad-spectrum in-vitro and invivo activity against numerous RNA viruses, including
SARS-CoV-. In animal models, compared with lopinavir
plus ritonavir combined with interferon beta, two other
potential candidates, remdesivir more significantly
reduced the virus titre of mice infected with the
MERS-CoV and decreased the lung tissue damage.
Remdesivir treatment improved disease outcomes and
reduced viral loads in SARS-CoV-infected mice and is
inhibitory for SARS-CoV- in vitro. A phase  clinical
trial assessed this drug for the treatment of Ebola virus
infection; therefore, data exist for the safety of use in
humans. Hence, on the basis of expert opinion, we
considered remdesivir use in the three patients with
severe disease patterns. To the best of our knowledge, only
one case of remdesivir use in COVID- has been reported
so far. Two randomised controlled trials are enrolling
patients in China to assess the clinical benefit of this
treatment (NCT; NCT). On the basis of
our data, we cannot draw any conclusions on the potential
efficacy of remdesivir on COVID- infections. In
two patients, the drug was initiated at the time of disease
worsening, when the virus was already barely detectable
in the clinical specimens. In one of them, remdesivir was
discontinued after  days because of a combined alanine
aminotransferase elevation and a rash, although it could
not be confirmed that this adverse event was related to

remdesivir. In the third patient, remdesivir was discon­
tinued after a single dose because of renal replacement
therapy to avoid risk of cyclodextrin accumulation.
Remdesivir contains cyclodextrin, an excipient whose
clearance is linearly related to creatinine clearance.
Because the patient’s condition was worsening and viral
load was not decreasing, we reinitiated remdesivir.
In this paper, we report clinical and virological data on
the first cases of COVID- in Europe. Although we
acknowledge the fact that the results provided are based
on a small number of cases, a detailed and comprehensive
sampling strategy enabled us to illustrate the different
courses of the disease we observed, and provide some
relevant criteria regarding the severity of disease. We
believe that these findings will contribute to better
understanding of the natural history of the disease and
will contribute to advances in the implementation of
more efficient infection control strategies.
