Abstract
There is a rising global concern for the recently emerged novel coronavirus (2019‐
nCoV). Full genomic sequences have been released by the worldwide scientific
community in the last few weeks to understand the evolutionary origin and molecular
characteristics of this virus. Taking advantage of all the genomic information currently
available, we constructed a phylogenetic tree including also representatives of other
coronaviridae, such as Bat coronavirus (BCoV) and severe acute respiratory
syndrome. We confirm high sequence similarity (>99%) between all sequenced 2019‐
nCoVs genomes available, with the closest BCoV sequence sharing 96.2% sequence
identity, confirming the notion of a zoonotic origin of 2019‐nCoV. Despite the low
heterogeneity of the 2019‐nCoV genomes, we could identify at least two hypervariable genomic hotspots, one of which is responsible for a Serine/Leucine variation in
the viral ORF8‐encoded protein. Finally, we perform a full proteomic comparison with
other coronaviridae, identifying key aminoacidic differences to be considered for
antiviral strategies deriving from previous anti‐coronavirus approaches.
