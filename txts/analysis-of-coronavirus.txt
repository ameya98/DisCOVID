Abstract
In December 2019, a novel coronavirus was found in a seafood wholesale market in Wuhan, China.
WHO officially named this coronavirus as COVID-19. Since the first patient was hospitalized on
December 12, 2019, China has reported a total of 78,824 confirmed CONID-19 cases and 2,788 deaths
as of February 28, 2020. Wuhan's cumulative confirmed cases and deaths accounted for 61.1% and 76.5%
of the whole China mainland , making it the priority center for epidemic prevention and control.
Meanwhile, 51 countries and regions outside China have reported 4,879 confirmed cases and 79 deaths
as of February 28, 2020. COVID-19 epidemic does great harm to people's daily life and country's
economic development. This paper adopts three kinds of mathematical models, i.e., Logistic model,
Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model. The epidemic trends of SARS were first fitted and analyzed in
order to prove the validity of the existing mathematical models. The results were then used to fit and
analyze the situation of COVID-19. The prediction results of three different mathematical models are
different for different parameters and in different regions. In general, the fitting effect of Logistic model
may be the best among the three models studied in this paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model
may be better than Bertalanffy model. According to the current trend, based on the three models, the total
number of people expected to be infected is 49852-57447 in Wuhan,12972-13405 in non-Hubei areas
and 80261-85140 in China respectively. The total death toll is 2502-5108 in Wuhan, 107-125 in NonHubei areas and 3150-6286 in China respetively. COVID-19 will be over p robably in late-April, 2020
in Wuhan and before late-March, 2020 in other areas respectively.

epimedic prediction

1 Introduction
A number of unexplained pneumonia cases have successively been discovered in China since December
2019, which have been confirmed to be acute respiratory infectious diseases caused by a novel
coronavirus. The outbreak of COVID-19 has experienced three stages since mid-December 2019: local
outbreak, community transmission and large-scale transmission. ①Local outbreak stage: This stage
mainly forms a local outbreak among the people exposed to the seafood market before the end of
December 2019. Most of the cases at this stage were related to the exposure of seafood market. ②
Community transmission stage: due to the spread of the epidemic, the virus spread to communities
through the early-infected people, forming community transmission. Interpersonal and cluster
transmission occurred in multiple communities and families in Wuhan. ③The stage of large-scale
transmission of the spread of the epidemic : The epidemic rapidly expanded and spread from Hubei
Province to other parts of China due to the great mobility of personnel during the Chinese Lunar New
Year, while the number of COVID-19 cases in other countries gradually increased.

As of 24:00 on February 29, 2020, China has reported a total of 79,824 confirmed cases of COVID-19
and 2,870 deaths1. The cumulative number of confirmed cases and deaths in Wuhan accounted for 61.5%
and 76.5% of the country respectively, which is the priority area for epidemic prevention and control. At
the same time, countries and regions outside China reported 7,661 confirmed cases and a total of 121
deaths. Infectious diseases cause disastrous harm to human society and are one of the important factors
that seriously threaten human life and health, restrict social and economic development and endanger
national security and stability. The effects of economic globalization, internationalization of production,
more convenient transportation, and faster human and cargo flows have created favorable conditions for
the widespread spread of infectious diseases, making the spread of infectious diseases faster and wider2.
Some infectious diseases that have occurred in recent years, such as COVID-19, SARS in 2003, influenza
HIN1, H5N1, etc., have greatly affected human health and social life. How to contain the outbreak of
infectious diseases and ease the spread of infectious diseases is an urgent issue facing the society at
present3.
Theoretical analysis, quantitative analysis and simulation are needed for the prediction of various
infectious diseases. The above analysis cannot be carried out without models established for various
infectious diseases.
Infectious disease transmission is a complicated diffusion process occurring in the crowd. Models can be
established for this process to analyze and study the transmission process of infectious diseases
theoretically4, so that we can accurately predict the future development trend of infectious diseases5.
Therefore, in order to control or reduce the harm of infectious diseases, the research and analysis of
infectious disease prediction models have become a hot research topic6.
1.1 Traditional infectious disease prediction model
Traditional infectious disease prediction models mainly include differential equation prediction models
and time series prediction models based on statistics and random processes.
The differential equation prediction models are to establish a differential equation that can reflect the
dynamic characteristics of infectious diseases according to the characteristics of population growth, the
occurrence of diseases and the laws of transmission within the population. Through qualitative and
quantitative analysis and numerical simulation of the model dynamics, the occurrence process of diseases
is displayed, the transmission laws are revealed, the change and development trends are predicted, the
causes and key factors of disease transmission are analyzed, the optimal strategies for prevention and
control are sought, and the theoretical basis and quantitative basis are provided for people to make
prevention and control decisions. Common models for predicting infectious disease dynamics differential
equations have ordinary differential systems, which directly reflect the relationship between the
instantaneous rate of change of individuals in each compartment and the corresponding time of all
compartments. Partial differential system is a common model system when considering age structure.
Delay differential system is a kind of differential system that appears when the structure of the stage is
considered (e.g. the infected person has a definite infectious period, the latent person has a definite
incubation period, the immunized person has a definite immune period, etc. The currently widely studied
and applied models include SI model, SIS model, SIR model and SEIR model, etc7. System individuals

are divided into different categories, and each category is in a state, respectively: S (Susceptible),
E(Exposed), I (Infected) and R (Remove).
The classical differential equation prediction model assumes that the total number of people in a certain
area is a constant, which can prompt the natural transmission process of infectious diseases, describe the
evolution relationship of different types of nodes with time, and reveal the overall information
transmission law. However, in practice, the population is changing over time. There will always be some
form of interaction with other populations in terms of food, resources and living space. The connection
between individuals is random, and the difference between spreading individuals is ignored, thus limiting
the application scope of the model.
Time series prediction models, based on statistics and random processes, predict infectious diseases by
analyzing one-dimensional time series of infectious disease incidence, mainly including Autoregressive
Integrated Moving Average model (ARIMA), Exponential Smoothing method (ES), Grey Model (GM),
Markov chain method (MC), etc. The widely used time series prediction model is ARIMA prediction
model, which uses several differences to make it a stationary series, and then represent this sequence as
a combination autoregression about the sequence up to a certain point in the past8.
The infectious disease prediction model established by this method relies on curve fitting and parameter
estimation of available time series data, so it is difficult to apply it to a large number of irregular data.
1.2 Internet-based infectious disease prediction model
Infectious disease surveillance research based on the Internet has begun to rise since the mid-1990s9. It
can provide information services for public health management institutions, medical workers and the
public. After analyzing and processing, it can provide users with early warning and situational awareness
information of infectious diseases10.
In the early research, traditional Web page web information (for example, related news topics,
authoritative organizations, etc.) was the main data source. However, with the development of the
Internet, research has begun to expand data sources to social media (such as Twitter, Facebook, microblog,
etc.) and multimedia information in recent years. Due to the global spread of the Internet, people use
Internet search engines, social networks and online map tools to track the frequency and location
information of query keywords, strengthen the integration of information on social, public focus and hot
issues, realize disease monitoring based on search engines and social media, and predict the incidence of
infectious diseases, which can provide important reference for the decision and management of infectious
disease prevention and control11.
In theory, Internet search tracking is efficient, and can reflect the real-time status of infectious diseases.
Therefore, the infectious disease prediction models based on Internet and search engine are good
supplement to the traditional infectious disease prediction models12. U.S. scientists compared the flu
estimates in different countries and regions from 2004 to 2009 with the official flu surveillance data, and
found that the estimates from Google search engine were close to historical flu epidemic13. Jiwei et al.
filtered the Twitter data stream, retained flu-related information, and tagged the information with
geographic location to show where the flu-related Twitter information came from and how the

information changed over a certain period of time. They counted 3.6 million flu-related Twitter messages
published by about 1 million users from June 2008 to June 2010, showing that there is a highly positive
correlation between Twitter's influenza information and influenza outbreak data provided by the U.S.
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention14. In 2011, Google launched Google Dengue Trends (GDT)
and in 2016, Google Flu Trends (GFT) and other tools to quantitatively track the spread trend of
infectious diseases such as dengue fever and influenza in multiple regions of the world according to
Google's search patterns15.
Compared with the traditional prediction models, the Internet-based infectious disease prediction models
have the advantages of real-time and fast, which can predict the incidence trend of infectious diseases as
early as possible, and are suitable for data analysis of a large number of people. However, the sensitivity,
spatial resolution and accuracy of its prediction need to be further improved. So Internet-based infectious
disease prediction models cannot replace the traditional prediction models, and they can just be used as
an extension of the traditional infectious disease prediction model16.
This paper will use 2003 SARS data to verify three mathematical models (Logistic model, Bertalanffy
model and Gompertz model) to predict the development trend of the virus, and then use these three
models to fit and analyze the epidemic trend of COVID-19 in Wuhan, mainland China and non-Hubei
areas, including the total number of confirmed cases, the number of deaths and the end time of the
epidemic.
1.3 Early Prediction Model of Infectious Diseases Based on Machine Learning
In short, machine learning is to learn more useful information from a large amount of data using its own
algorithm model for specific problems. Machine learning spans a variety of fields, such as medicine,
computer science, statistics, engineering technology, psychology, etc17. For example, neural network, a
relatively mature machine learning algorithm, can simulate any high-dimensional non-linear optimal
mapping between input and output by imitating the processing function of the biological brain's nervous
system. When faced with complex data relations, the traditional statistical method is not such effective,
which may not receive accurate results as the neural network18.
Since most new infectious diseases occurring in human beings are of animal origin (animal infectious
diseases), it is an effective prerequisite to predict diseases by determining the common intrinsic
characteristics of species and environmental conditions that lead to the overflow of new infections. By
analyzing the intrinsic characteristics of wild species through machine learning, new reservoirs
(mammals) and carriers (insects) of zoonotic diseases can be accurately predicted19. The overall goal of
machine learning-based approach is to extend causal inference theory and machine learning to identify
and quantify the most important factors that cause zoonotic disease outbreaks, and to generate visual
tools to illustrate the complex causal relationships of animal infectious diseases and their correlation with
zoonotic diseases20. However, the highly nonlinear and complex problems to be analyzed in the early
prediction model of infectious diseases based on machine learning usually lead to local minima and
global minima, leading to some limitations of the machine learning model.

2 Mathematical model

Infectious disease prediction models mainly include differential equation prediction models based on
dynamics and time series prediction models based on statistics and random

processes, Internet-based

infectious disease prediction model and machine learning methods. Some models are too complicated
and too many factors are considered, which often leads to over-fitting. In this paper, Logistic model,
Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model, which are relatively simple but accord with the statistical law
of epidemiology, are selected to predict the epidemic situation of COVID-19. After the model is selected,
the least square method

is used for curve fitting. Least square method is a mathematical optimization

technique. It finds the best function match of data by minimizing the sum of squareed errors. Using the
least square method, unknown data can be easily obtained, and the sum of squares of errors between
these obtained data and actual data is minimized.
2.1 Model Selection
(1) Logistic model
Logistic model is mainly used in epidemiology. It is commonly to explore the risk factors of a certain
disease, and predict the probability of occurrence of a certain disease according to the risk factors. We
can roughly predict the development and transmission law of epidemiology through logistic regression
analysis,.

t is the number of days since the first case. t 0 is the time when the first

(2) Bertalanffy model
Bertalanffy model is often used as a growth model. It is mainly used to study the factors that control and
affect the growth. It is used to describe the growth characteristics of fish. Other species can also be used
to describe the growth of animals, such as pigs, horses, cattle, sheep, etc. and other infectious diseases.
The development of infectious diseases is similar to the growth of individuals and populations. In this
paper, Bertalanffy model is selected to describe the spread law of infectious diseases and to study the
factors that control and affect the spread of COVID-19.

The model was originally proposed by Gomperts (Gompertz,1825) as an animal population growth
model to describe the extinction law of the population. The development of infectious diseases is similar
to the growth of individuals and populations. In this paper, Gompertz model is selected to describe the
spread law of infectious diseases and to study the factors that control and affect the spread of COVID19.

2.2 Model Evaluation
The regression coefficient (R2) is used to evaluate the fitting ability of various methods and can be
obtained by the following equation.

𝑅𝑅2 = 1 −

∑(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 −𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖 )2
∑(𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 −𝑦𝑦�)2

(4)

𝑦𝑦𝑖𝑖 is the actual cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases; 𝑦𝑦�𝑖𝑖 is the predicted cumulative confirmed

COVID-19 cases; 𝑦𝑦� is the average of the actual cumulative confirmed COVID-19 cases. The closer the

fitting coefficient is to 1, the more accurate the prediction.

3 Fitting and analysis of SARS epidemic
As COVID-19 and SARS virus are both coronaviruses, the infection pattern may be similar. Firstly, we
used SARS data to verify the rationality of our model.
3.1 Number of Confirmed Cases
The cumulative confirmed SARS data after April 21, 2003 were selected to be fitted by Gompertz model,
Logistic model and Bertalanffy model. The results are shown in Figure 1. From the overall view, these
three models can accurately predict the cumulative number of confirmed cases, in which Logistic model
and Gompertz model are better than Bertalanffy model.
The number of confirmed SARS cases no longer increased after June 11, 2003. On June 24, 2003, WHO
announced the end of the SARS epidemic, that is, the time when the cumulative number of confirmed
SARS cases reached the peak value was basically the time when the epidemic ended. We used this rule
to predict the end of COVID-19 epidemic21.

The fitting of the death toll of SARS in 2003 is shown in Figure 2, which shows that Gompertz model
and Logistic model can predict the death toll of SARS well. The good fitting of the death toll of SARS

4 Fitting and analysis of COVID-19 epidemic
4.1 Number of Confirmed Cases
The cumulative number of confirmed cases of the novel coronavirus (hereinafter referred to as COVID19 ) is shown in Figure 3. The number of confirmed cases has dramatically increased in China since the
first case was confirmed. The epidemic spreads to other parts of Hubei and the whole country with Wuhan
as the center. Since the main confirmed cases were in Wuhan, the development trend of new confirmed
cases in the whole country are basically the same with Wuhan. Judging from the prediction results, the
three models can predict the epidemic situation of COVID-19 well in the later stage of the epidemic.
Among them, Logistic model is better than the other two models in fitting all the data in Wuhan, while
Gompertz model is better in fitting the data outside Wuhan.
Due to various reasons, It is worth noting that the number of confirmed cases suddenly increased by
13,332 on February 12, 2020.Obviously, the mutation of this data does not originate from the mechanism
of the virus, so our treatment method is to remove the impact of this part of data mutation (13,332
people).Then, the impact of the sudden increase confirmed cases will be considered in the later fitting
analysis.
According to the daily real-time updated data of COVID-19, we used the above three mathematical
models (Logistic model, Bertalanffy model and Gompertz model) to carry out fitting analysis on the
epidemic of COVID-19. The prediction results are shown in Table 1 in which a is the prediction of
cumulative confirmed number (the final predicted cumulative confirmed number = a+13332); b and c
are fitting coefficients; t is the number of days since the first case. R2(C) means the fitting goodness of
cumulative confirmed cases, R2(N) means the fitting goodness of new confirmed cases

According to the calculation results of the three models, it is estimated that the final cumulative number
of confirmed cases of COVID-19 in Wuhan is 49852-57447.Non-Hubei areas: 12972-13405; China
mainland: 80261-85140, respectively.

In order to predict the turning point, we use the above three models to compare the new confirmed cases
in Wuhan, China mainland and non-Hubei areas. As can be seen in Figure 4, the turning points in W
Wuhan, China mainland and non-Hubei areas are February 9, February 6 and February 2, 2020
respectively. From the results, for the prediction of newly confirmed cases, the three models can predict
the COVID-19 epidemic well in the early and late stages of the epidemic. Among them, the Logistic
model is better than the other two models in fitting all the data.

The death toll of COVID-19 in China is mainly concentrated in Wuhan, Hubei province, so the trend of
the death toll in China are basically the same with Wuhan. Similarly, Gompertz, Logistic and Bertalanffy
models were used to predict the final death toll of COVID-19. The results are shown in Figure 5.

Figure 5 Three Models for Predicting COVID-19 death toll
The fitting parameters of each model can be seen in Table 2 in which a is the prediction of the death toll;
b and c are fitting coefficients; t is the number of days since the first case. R2(DC) means the fitting
goodness of cumulative deaths.
According to the available data, the death toll predicted by the three models is Wuhan: 2502-5108; nonHubei areas: 107-125; China mainland: 3150-6286.As we can see, the results of the death toll predicted
by the three models are quite different. It may be due to the fact that the factors affecting the death rate
during the epidemic period are more than the cumulative confirmed number and the newly confirmed
number, such as the continuous improvement of treatment level, emergency equipment and measures,
etc. However, judging from the fitting precision of the models in Figure 4, the Logistic model is obviously
better than the other two models. Considering that the later fitting results of the mathematical model is
more important than the earlier fitting results, the fitting results of Logistic model may be more accurate,
that is, the total death toll of COVID-19 is about 2502 in Wuhan, 107 in non-Hubei areas and 2150 in
China mainland, respectively.

5 Discussion
The prediction methods of Logistic model, Gompertz model and Bertalanffy model are similar, but the
mathematical models are different. From the results, for the prediction of the cumulative number of
confirmed diagnoses, the three models can better predict the development trend of the COVID-19
epidemic in the later stages of the epidemic. Among them, the Logistic model is better than the other two
models in fitting all the data in Wuhan, while Gompertz model is better in fitting the data in non-Hubei
areas. For the prediction of newly confirmed cases, the three models can all well predict the epidemic
situation of the COVID-19 in the early and late stages of the epidemic. Among them, the fitting result of
Logistic model for all data in Wuhan and non-Hubei areas is better than the other two models. For the
prediction of the cumulative death toll, the fitting coefficients of the three models are relatively high, and
the figure can be well predicted at the later stage of the epidemic. Various medical resources are becoming
more abundant in the later period, the capabilities of medical personnel in various aspects are getting
stronger, the support for various resources across the country is getting stronger, and the ability to refine
management and treatment is getting stronger. These factors are likely to rapidly reduce the mortality
rate of COVID-19. The above factors may also have some influence on the cumulative number of

confirmed cases, but due to the large number of confirmed cases, the influence of these favorable human
factors on the cumulative number of confirmed cases may be small.
At present, there are only a few papers on the prediction of COVID-19 epidemic. We have collected
some COVID-19 epidemic predictions of other researchers, as shown in Table 3. It can be seen from
Table 3 that the total prediction results of different models are quite different. According to the prediction
results of this article, the cumulative number of confirmed cases will reach maximum in Wuhan and the
country around the end of March 2020 at the earliest and around April 2020 at the latest. The results are
basically consistent with the results of the Zhong’s team22 that the basic control of the epidemic was at
the end of April. The total number of confirmed diagnoses is predicted to be 49852-57447 in Wuhan,
12972-13405 in Non-Hubei areas, and 80261-85140 in China mainland. The predicted total death toll is
2502-5108 in Wuhan, 107-125 in non-Hubei areas, and 3150-6286 in China mainland.
It should be noted that the China mainland data in this article are the data of 31 provinces (autonomous
regions, municipalities) and Xinjiang Production and Construction Corps.
In addition, another concerned question is: When will the epidemic of the new coronavirus COVID-19
end? Judging from the SARS situation in 2003, the date corresponding to the maximum number of
cumulative diagnoses was basically the date when the epidemic ended. According to the results and data
of this article, it is estimated that the epidemic of COVID-19 in novel coronavirus will end at the end of
April 2020 in Wuhan and at the end of March 2020 in Non-Hubei areas.
It is worth noting that the above results and conclusions are under the precondition that the prevention
and control measures for the epidemic situation of COVID-19 are stable and reliable, foreign cases are
not imported into China on a large scale, and the virus of COVID-19 does not produce new and serious
acute variations.

6 Conclusion
(1) It is estimated that COVID-19 will be over probably in late-April, 2020 in Wuhan and before late-March, 2020 in
other areas respectively;

(2) The cumulative number of confirmed COVID-19 cases is 49852-57447 in Wuhan, 12972-13405 in non-Hubei areas
and 80261-85140 in China mainland;

(3) According to the current trend, the cumulative death toll predicted by the three models are: 2502-5108 in
(4)
(5)

Wuhan,
107-125 in non-Hubei areas, and 3150-6286 in China mainland;
According to the fitting analysis of the existing data by the three mathematical models, the inflection points of the
COVID-19 epidemic in Wuhan, non-Hubei areas and China mainland is basically in the middle of February 2020;
The prediction results of three different mathematical models are different for different parameters and in different
regions. In general, the fitting effect of Logistic model may be the best among the three models studied in this
paper, while the fitting effect of Gompertz model may be better than Bertalanffy model.
