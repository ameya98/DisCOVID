Corona virus is large in size where the cell diameter is 400-500 micro and for
this reason any mask prevents its entry
The virus does not settle in the air but is grounded, so it is not transmitted by
air.
Coronavirus when it falls on a metal surface, it will live 12 hours, so washing
hands with soap and water well enough.
Corona virus when it falls on the fabric remains 9 hours, so washing clothes or
being exposed to the sun for two hours meets the purpose of killing it
The virus lives on the hands for 10 minutes. so putting an alcohol sterilizer in
the pocket meets the purpose of prevention.
If the virus is exposed to a temperature of 26-27Â° C. it will be killed, as it does
not live in hot regions. Also drinking hot water and sun exposure will do the
trick
And staying away from ice cream and eating cold is important.
Gargle with warm and salt water kills the tonsils gems and prevents them
from leaking into the lungs.
Adherence to these instructions fulfills the purpose of preventing viruses.
