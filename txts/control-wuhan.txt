Summary

Background In December, 2019, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus,
emerged in Wuhan, China. Since then, the city of Wuhan has taken unprecedented measures in response to
the outbreak, including extended school and workplace closures. We aimed to estimate the effects of physical
distancing measures on the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of
the world.
Methods To examine how changes in population mixing have affected outbreak progression in Wuhan, we used
synthetic location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted these in the presence of school closures, extended
workplace closures, and a reduction in mixing in the general community. Using these matrices and the latest
estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan outbreak, we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an
outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptible-exposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model for several physical
distancing measures. We fitted the latest estimates of epidemic parameters from a transmission model to data on
local and internationally exported cases from Wuhan in an age-structured epidemic framework and investigated the
age distribution of cases. We also simulated lifting of the control measures by allowing people to return to work in a
phased-in way and looked at the effects of returning to work at different stages of the underlying outbreak (at the
beginning of March or April).
Findings Our projections show that physical distancing measures were most effective if the staggered return to work
was at the beginning of April; this reduced the median number of infections by more than 92% (IQR 66–97) and
24% (13–90) in mid-2020 and end-2020, respectively. There are benefits to sustaining these measures until April in
terms of delaying and reducing the height of the peak, median epidemic size at end-2020, and affording health-care
systems more time to expand and respond. However, the modelled effects of physical distancing measures vary by the
duration of infectiousness and the role school children have in the epidemic.
Interpretation Restrictions on activities in Wuhan, if maintained until April, would probably help to delay the epidemic
peak. Our projections suggest that premature and sudden lifting of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary
peak, which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions gradually. However, there are limitations to our analysis,
including large uncertainties around estimates of R0 and the duration of infectiousness.

Introduction
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2
(SARS-CoV-2), a novel coronavirus, emerged in the city
of Wuhan, Hubei, China, in early December, 2019.1,2
Since then, the local and national governments have
taken unprecedented measures in response to the
coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) outbreak caused by
SARS-CoV-2.3 Exit screening of passengers was shortly
followed by travel restrictions in Wuhan on Jan 23, 2020,
halting all means of unauthorised travel into and
out of the city. Similar control measures were extended
to the entire province of Hubei by Jan 26, 2020.3

Non-pharmaceutical physical distancing inter­
ventions,
such as extended school closures and workplace dis­
tancing, were introduced to reduce the impact of the
COVID-19 outbreak in Wuhan.4 Within the city, schools
remained closed, Lunar New Year holidays were extended
so that people stayed away from their workplaces, and
the local government promoted physical distancing
and encouraged residents to avoid crowded places.
These measures greatly changed age-specific mixing
patterns within the population in previous outbreak
response efforts for other respiratory infectious
diseases.5,6 Although travel restrictions undoubtedly

Research in context
Evidence before this study
Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
emerged in Wuhan, China in late 2019. In mid-January, 2020,
schools and workplaces closed as part of the Lunar New Year
holidays. These closures were then extended to prevent
SARS-CoV-2 spread. The intended effect of such physical
distancing measures was to reduce person-to-person contact,
which spreads infectious diseases. Epidemic parameters, such as
time-dependent reproduction numbers governing SARS-CoV-2
transmission in Wuhan, have been estimated based on local
and internationally exported cases. The frequency of contacts in
different age groups and locations (schools, workplaces,
households, and others) in China has also been previously
estimated. We searched PubMed and medRxiv for studies
published in English up to March 7, 2020, with the terms
“coronavirus AND (school OR work) AND (Wuhan OR Hubei)”
and identified 108 and 130 results, respectively. However, to
our knowledge, no published article has reported use of
location-specific transmission models that consider the impacts
of school or workplace closures to study the spread of
SARS-CoV-2 in Wuhan.

had a role in reducing exportations of infections outside
Wuhan and delayed the onset of outbreaks in other
regions,7,8 changes in mixing patterns affected the tra­
jectory of the outbreak within Wuhan itself. To estimate
the effects of physical distancing measures on
the progression of the COVID-19 epidemic, we look at
Wuhan, hoping to provide some insights for the rest of
the world.
Person-to-person transmission is mostly driven by
who interacts with whom,9,10 which can vary by age and
location of the contact (ie, school, work, home, and
community). Under the context of a large-scale ongoing
outbreak, contact patterns would drastically shift from
their baseline conditions. In the COVID-19 outbreak in
Wuhan, physical distancing measures, including but not
limited to school and workplace closures and health
promotions that encourage the general public to avoid
crowded places, are designed to drastically shift social
mixing patterns and are often used in epidemic settings.4
Although contact patterns can be inferred from reported
social contact data that include information on which
setting the contact took place in, such studies are often
focused on high-income countries,11 or particular highdensity areas.12 This limitation can be addressed by
quantifying contact patterns in the home, school, work,
and other locations across a range of countries based on
available information from household-level data and
local population demographic structures.13
To examine how these changes in population mixing
have affected the outbreak progression, we used synthetic
location-specific contact patterns in Wuhan and adapted
these in the presence of school closures, extended
2	

Added value of this study
We built an age-specific and location-specific transmission
model to assess progression of the Wuhan outbreak under
different scenarios of school and workplace closure.
We found that changes to contact patterns are likely to have
substantially delayed the epidemic peak and reduced the
number of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) cases in
Wuhan. If these restrictions are lifted in March, 2020, a
second peak of cases might occur in late August, 2020.
Such a peak could be delayed by 2 months if the restrictions
were relaxed a month later, in April, 2020.
Implications of all the available evidence
The measures put in place to reduce contacts in school and
work are helping to control the COVID-19 outbreak by affording
health-care systems time to expand and respond. Authorities
need to carefully consider epidemiological and modelling
evidence before lifting these measures to mitigate the
impact of a second peak in cases.

workplace closures, and reduction in mixing in the
general community. Using these matrices and the latest
estimates of the epidemiological parameters of the Wuhan
outbreak,1,9,14–16 we simulated the ongoing trajectory of an
outbreak in Wuhan using an age-structured susceptibleexposed-infected-removed (SEIR) model17,18 for several
physical distancing measures.

Methods

SEIR model
We simulated the outbreak in Wuhan using a deter­
ministic stage-structured SEIR model over a 1 year
period, during which the modelled outbreak peters out.
An implication of this approach is that all demographic
changes in the population (ie, births, deaths, and ageing)
are ignored.
We divided the population according to the infection
status into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and
removed (R) individuals, and according to age into 5-year
bands until age 70 years and a single category aged 75
and older (resulting in 16 age categories). Susceptible
individuals might acquire the infection at a given rate
when they come in contact with an infectious person and
enter the exposed disease state before they become
infectious and later either recover or die. We assumed
Wuhan to be a closed system with a constant population
size of 11 million (ie, S + E + I + R=11 million) throughout
the course of this epidemic. We used the SEIR model
presented in figure 1. The age-specific mixing patterns of
individuals in age group i alter their likelihood of being
exposed to the virus given a certain number of infectious
people in the population. Additionally, we incorporated

Where β is the transmission rate (scaled to the right
value of R0), Ci,j describe the contacts of age group j made
by age group i, κ=1-exp(–1/dL) is the daily probability of an
exposed individual becoming infectious (with dL being
the average incubation period), and γ=1–exp(–1/dI) is
the daily probability that an infected individual recovers
when the average duration of infection is dI. We
also incorporated contributions of asymptomatic and
subclinical cases, 1–ρi denotes the probability of an
infected case being asymptomatic or subclinical. We
assumed that younger individuals are more likely to be
asymptomatic (or subclinical) and less infectious
(proportion of infectiousness compared to Ic, α).
Using parameters from the literature as presented in
the table, we simulated the outbreak. We assumed the
mean incubation period and mean infectious period to
be 6·4 days16 and 3 days or 7 days,22 respectively. Each
simulation started with 200 or 2000 infectious individuals
I0,15 with the rest of the population being in the susceptible
state. We explored the uncertainty in the model by
drawing R0 values uniformly from the 95% CI from the
posterior of the R0 distribution from the semi-mechanistic
model by Kucharski and colleagues (appendix p 2).14

Social mixing and interventions
Social mixing patterns vary across locations, including
households, workplaces, schools, and other locations.
Therefore, we used the method set out by Prem and
colleagues,13 which accounts for these differences and
obtains the location-specific contact matrices (C) for
different scenarios. In a normal setting, contacts made at
all of these locations contribute to the overall mixing
pattern in a population, so we summed contacts across
the different locations to obtain our baseline contact

however, the question of whether such individuals are

According to infection status, we divided the population into susceptible (S), exposed (E), infected (I), and
removed (R) individuals. An infected individual in an age group can be clinical (Ic) or subclinical (Isc), and ρi refers to
the probability that an individual is symptomatic or clinical. The age-specific mixing patterns of individuals in age
group i, Ci,j, alter their likelihood of being exposed to the virus given a certain number of infected individuals in the
population. Younger individuals are more likely to be asymptomatic and less infectious, ie, subclinical. When ρi=0

Figure 2: Synthetic age-specific and location-specific contact matrices for China under various physical distancing scenarios during the intense control period for China
Synthetic age-specific contact patterns across all locations, at home, in the workplace, in school, and at other locations during normal circumstances (ie, under no intervention) are presented in
panels A to E. Age-specific and location-specific contact matrices under the various physical distancing interventions are presented in panels F to T. Darker colour intensities indicate higher proclivity of
making the age-specific contact.

Year holidays: assumed no physical distancing control
measures, school-going individuals did not have any
contacts at school because of school holidays from Jan 15,
to Feb 10, 2020, and 10% and later 75% of workforce would
be working during the holidays from Jan 25, to Jan 31, 2020,
and from Feb 1, to Feb 10, 2020, respectively; and third
scenario, intense control measures in Wuhan to contain
the outbreak: assumed school closure and about 10% of
workforce (eg, health-care personnel, police, and other
4	

essential government staff) would be working even during
the control measures (figures 1, 2). For the third scenario,
we modelled the effect of the intense control measures
ending at the beginning of March or April, and we allowed
for a staggered return to work while the school remained
closed (ie, 25% of the workforce working in weeks one and
two, 50% of the workforce working in weeks three and
four, and 100% of the workforce working and school
resuming (figure 2).3,23,24

Results
Our simulations showed that control measures aimed
at reducing social mixing in the population can be
effective in reducing the magnitude and delaying the
peak of the COVID-19 outbreak. For different control
measures among individuals aged 55 to <60 years
and 10 to <15 years, the standard school winter
break and holidays for the Lunar New Year would
have had little effect on progression of the outbreak

Discussion
COVID-19, a contact-transmissible infectious disease, is
thought to spread through a population via direct contact
between individuals.1,9,10 Outbreak control measures
aimed at reducing the amount of mixing in the
population have the potential to delay the peak and
reduce the final size of the epidemic. To evaluate
the effect of location-specific physical distancing
measures—such as extended school closures and
interventions in workplaces—on the timing and
magnitude of the peak and the final size of the epidemic,
we accounted for these heterogeneities in contact
networks in our model. We simulated outbreaks
and modelled the interventions by scaling down the
appropriate component of the contact mixing matrices
for China.

200 simulated outbreaks (figure 4). Intense control
measures of prolonged school closure and work holidays
reduced the cumulative infections by end-2020 and peak
incidence, while also delaying the peak of the outbreak
(figure 4). Our model suggests that the effects of these
physical distancing strategies vary across age categories;
the reduction in incidence is highest among school
children and older individuals and lowest among
working-age adults (figure 4; figure 5).
Physical distancing measures were most effective if the
staggered return to work was at the beginning of April;
this reduced the median number of infections by more
than 92% (IQR 66–97) and 24% (13–90) in mid-2020 and
end-2020, respectively (figure 5; appendix p 3), should
the disease have a longer duration of infectiousness, and
reduced the magnitude and delayed peak incidence
across all age categories (figure 4), which could have had
further beneficial impact by relieving the pressure on the
health-care system in the immediate few months after
the outbreak began. Uncertainty in R0 values has a large
effect on the timing of the epidemic peak and final size of
the outbreak (figure 4).
The modelled effects of the intense control measures
of prolonged school closure and work holidays vary by
the duration of infectiousness. If the disease had a short
infectious period (3 days), then our model suggests
that relaxing physical distancing interventions in March
(figure 5; appendix p 4) could avert around 30% of cases
in school children and older individuals. Fewer cases
could be averted by end-2020 should the disease have a
longer duration of infectiousness (eg, 7 days; figure 5);
physical distancing interventions would need to be
relaxed a month later (in April) to observe a larger effect.
If children were less infectious, lifting physical distancing
interventions in April instead of March could engender
additional health benefits (figure 5; appendix pp 5–6).

Mathematical models can help us understand how
SARS-CoV-2 could spread across the population and
inform control measures that might mitigate future
transmission.25,26 We simulated the trajectory of the
ongoing outbreak of COVID-19 in Wuhan using an agestructured SEIR model.17,18 As individuals’ mixing patterns
are non-random, they influence the transmission
dynamics of the disease.11 Models that assess the effective­
ness of physical distancing interventions, such as school
closure, need to account for social structures
and heterogeneities in mixing of individuals.27–31 In our
model, we incorporated changes to age-specific and
location-specific social mixing patterns to estimate the
effects of location-specific physical distancing
interventions in curtailing the spread of the outbreak.
The measures put in place to reduce contacts at schools
and workplaces are helping control the outbreak by
providing the health-care system with the time and
opportunity to expand and respond. Consequently, if
these restrictions are lifted prematurely, while there are
still enough susceptible people to keep the Re>1 once
contacts increase, the number of infections would
increase. Realistically, interventions are lifted slowly,
partly as an attempt to avoid a sharp increase in infection,
but also for logistical and practical reasons. Therefore, we
simulated lifting the interventions in a staggered fashion.

Evidence of the effects of various physical dis­tancing
measures on containing the outbreak are scarce and
little is known about the behavioural changes of
individuals over time, either during an outbreak or
otherwise. Therefore, to model the effects of the physical
distancing measures implemented in Wuhan, we
assumed the effect that certain types of physical dis­
tancing have on age-specific and location-specific
contact rates.
Much is unknown about the true age-specific sus­
ceptibility and transmissibility of COVID-19. Therefore,
we assumed no heterogeneity in susceptibility between
children. Furthermore, for simplicity, we assumed that
children and adults were equally transmissible, other
than the differences in their contact rates (subclinical
children could be more infectious than subclinical adults;
appendix pp 5–6). Similar to an influenza-like pathogen,
our model suggests that interac­
tions between school
children and older individuals in the population have
important public health implications, as children might
have high infection rates but the elderly are more
vulnerable to severe infections, with potentially fatal
outcomes.32,33 However, unlike models built for pandemic
or seasonal flu, we accounted for the lack of population
immunity to SARS-CoV-2.
This study describes a mathematical model that
quantifies the potential impacts of physical distancing
policies, relying on Wuhan as a case study. Epidemio­
logical investigations during the WHO-China Joint
Mission on COVID-19 found many infections clustered
around households.34 Extreme physical distancing
measures, including school closures, workplace closures,
and avoidance of any public gatherings all at once can
push the transmission to households, leading to increased
clustering of household cases.5 As households are not
explicitly included in the model, we did not consider
heterogeneity and clustering of household transmission.
Distinguishing between repeated and new contacts is
important for disease propagation in contact network
models;35,36 more sophisticated methods that account for
temporal presence within the household37 would be
needed to characterise higher degrees of contact. Looking
at limitations of our study, our compartmental model does
not capture individual-level heterogeneity in contacts,
which could be important in super-spreading events,
particularly early in an epidemic. Combined with
nosocomial infections, the risk of COVID-19 infection is
potentially amplified with close contact between
confirmed cases and health-care workers. However, the
compartmental model we present is not equipped to
explicitly consider transmission within health-care
institutions and households. More complex models, such
as individual-based models with familial and health-care
structures, should be explored. No­socomial infection risk
among health-care workers and patients has been
identified as a research gap to be prioritised in the next
few months by WHO.

A key parameter is the basic reproduction number (R0),
which determines how fast SARS-CoV-2 can spread
through the population during the early stages of the
outbreak. This is an inherently difficult parameter to
estimate, since the true number of cases that can
transmit infection at a given time is unknown (reported
cases are likely to be just a small fraction of true cases)
and probably varies over time (because of different
interventions being introduced and population behaviour
changing in response to the epidemic). In our analysis,
we used an existing model that inferred time-dependent
Re based on the growth of reported cases in Wuhan and
the number of exported cases outside China originating
from Wuhan.14 We acknowledge that the underlying
reproduction number in Wuhan could have been larger
than that used in our study. However, other studies of
early SARS-CoV-2 transmission dynamics in Wuhan,
using different methods, arrived at the same estimate
with similar ranges.1,9
Although the precise effects of interventions might
vary by country and different estimates of key para­
meters, our model highlights the usefulness of physical
distancing interventions and the need to carefully
calibrate their lifting to avoid second and subsequent
waves of a COVID-19 epidemic. Areas of China outside
Hubei and other east or southeast Asian regions have
managed to avert a major outbreak locally and delayed
the peak of the epidemic, without resorting to Hubei’s
extreme measures.38 Policy makers are advised to
reapportion their resources to focus on mitigating the
effects of potentially soon-to-be overwhelmed health
systems.39
Non-physical distancing factors play a part in mitigating
potential spikes in cases, especially when physical
distancing measures are relaxed. The effects of seasonality
on SARS-CoV-2 are difficult to predict without long time
series; supporting evidence for the link between climate
and COVID-19 has been largely anecdotal and based on
spread in different settings and such analyses are subject
to confounding.40,41 Consequently, we have not incorporated
climatic factors into our mathematical model. Future
research should be directed towards understanding the
potential seasonality of COVID-19 and the climatic factors
that could affect its transmission dynamics. Other
innovations, such as the rapid expansion of hospital
capacity and testing capabilities, would shorten diagnostic
and health system delays,3,38,39 thus reducing effective
interactions between infectious and susceptible indi­
viduals and interrupting transmission. Effective vaccines42
and antivirals43 that are being developed could counteract
this global public health threat. The extent to which these
strategies can detect cases earlier and isolate infectious
individuals from the susceptible pool or protect against
infection is less well-understood, hence nece­
ssitating
further evaluation.
Combined physical distancing and travel res­trictions
have aided in lowering the transmission of COVID-19

over the course of the ongoing outbreak in Wuhan.8,44,45
Evidence for this drop in transmission can be gleaned
from the time-varying estimates of the reproduction
number14 or observing that the turnover of the epidemic
has occurred far before depletion of susceptible
individuals, indicating the effects of the implemented
measures. It is difficult to quantify whether physical
distancing alone is responsible for the drop in cases,
especially during the ongoing epidemic. Therefore, we
took a broad view of this question, making assumptions
about the results of certain forms of physical distancing
and measuring the effects somewhat qualitatively.
However, to some extent, physical distancing has resulted
in both a shorter epidemic and a lower peak. Given what
is known about the transmissibility and (the relatively
long 5–6 days) incubation period of COVID-19,1,16 the
efficacy of physical distancing in reducing these
important attributes of any epidemic are no surprise.
In the analysis, we have varied the basic reproduction
number, the average duration of infections, the initial
proportion of cases infected, the susceptibility of children,
and the role of younger individuals in trans­
mission
dynamics of COVID-19.
In conclusion, non-pharmaceutical interventions based
on sustained physical distancing have a strong potential
to reduce the magnitude of the epidemic peak of
COVID-19 and lead to a smaller number of overall
cases. Lowering and flattening of the epidemic peak is
particularly important, as this reduces the acute pressure
on the health-care system. Premature and sudden lifting
of interventions could lead to an earlier secondary peak,
which could be flattened by relaxing the interventions
gradually.
