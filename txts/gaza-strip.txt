Structural violence in the
era of a new pandemic:
the case of the Gaza Strip
“Hope for improving health and
quality of life of Palestinians will exist
only once people recognise that the
structural and political conditions that
they endure…are the key determinants
of [Palestinian] population health.”
As the world is consumed by the
spread of coronavirus disease 
(COVID-), it should be of no
surprise that epidemics (and indeed,
pandemics) are disproportionately
violent to populations burdened
by poverty, military occupation,
discrimination, and institutionalised
oppression. Structural violence rooted
in historical, political, and social
injustices determines health patterns
and creates vulnerabilities that hamper
the effective prevention, detection,
and response to communicable disease
outbreaks. In the occupied Gaza Strip,
the convergence of these forces in the
era of a pandemic have the potential
to devastate one of the world’s most
vulnerable populations.,
The colonial fragmentation of
the Palestinian people and their
health systems, combined with a
neoliberal development framework
implemented during the past decades,
has created a profound dependency on
aid, placing health care at the mercy of
increasingly restrictive international
donor politics., Since , Israel has
imposed a crippling land, air, and sea
blockade over the Gaza Strip’s  million
Palestinians, · million of whom are
refugees, subjecting them to extreme
crowding in one of the world’s most
densely populated regions.
As a result, the Gaza Strip faces high
levels of poverty, unemployment, food
insecurity, and lacks sufficient clean
water, while the blockade disrupts
medical supply chains, curtails the
movement of patients and health
workers, and severely inhibits medical
capacity-building and public health
development. Preventive measures

and containment of COVID- will
be extremely difficult now that the
pandemic has reached the Gaza Strip.
While prisoners in Iran and elsewhere
are temporarily being released to
protect them from contained spread,
for Palestinians, living in what is
described as the largest open-air prison
in the world, there is nowhere to go—
unless, of course, they are granted
their legal and moral right of return.
Guided by our moral values
and professional obligations, the
international community must act
now to end structural violence by
confronting the historical and political
forces entrenching a cyclical, violent,
and mutable reality for Palestinians.
A COVID- pandemic that further
cripples the Gaza Strip’s health-care
system should not be viewed as an
inevitable biomedical phenomenon
experienced equally by the world’s
population, but as a preventable
biosocial injustice rooted in decades
of Israeli oppression and international
complicity in the struggle for the
health, fundamental rights, and selfdetermination of all Palestinians.
We declare no competing interests.
