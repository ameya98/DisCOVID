ABSTRACT
In the end of , the epidemic of a new coronavirus (SARS-CoV-) occurred
in Wuhan and spread rapidly. Changsha, a city located south to the epicenter,
was soon impacted. To control the transmission of the coronavirus and avoid
nosocomial infection, triage procedures based on epidemiology were
implemented in a local hospital of the city. This retrospective study analyzed
the data collected during the triage period and found that COVID- patients
were enriched seven folds into the Section A designated for rapid detection and
quarantine. On the other side, roughly triple amounts of visits were received at
the Section B for patients without obvious epidemiological history. Eight COVID cases were spotted out of  suspected patients. More than % of the
suspected patients were submitted to multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis
for SARS-CoV- infection. Of the  patients who were diagnosed as negative
of the virus infection, were successfully revisited and none was reported as
a COVID- case. Of the eight COVID- patients, three were confirmed only
after multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis. Besides comorbidities, delayed
sharing of epidemiological history added another layer of complexity to the
diagnosis in practice. While SARS-CoV- epidemic is being alerted in many
countries, our report will be helpful to other colleagues in rapid identification of
COVID- cases and controlling the transmission of the disease.

INTRODUCTION
The current epidemic of Coronavirus Diseases  (COVID-) associated
with the severe acute respiratory coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-) occurred in
Wuhan (Hubei province) in December  and rapidly spread to other areas
in China and more than  other countries.- According to the World Health
Organization (WHO), as of March , , the cumulative confirmed cases of
COVID- in China have reached   with  deaths (fatality rate .%).
More than % of the confirmed cases were reported from Wuhan. Besides
SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV- is the third coronavirus species from
the genus Betacoronavirus that leads to major epidemics in st century. To
prevent the disease transmission, China has suspended all public transport in
and out of Wuhan since January , .

Changsha, a city located  kilometers south of the epicenter, reported its first
imported COVID- case on January  and the highest level of public health
emergency response was declared two days later. The common symptoms of
COVID- patients at illness onset include fever, cough, expectoration,
headache, myalgia or fatigue, diarrhoea and haemoptysis.,, Some of these
symptoms resemble much like other diseases including flu, which has high
occurrence in winter. To avoid the transmission of SARS-CoV- within hospital,
triage procedures for patients were implemented between January  and
February  in a local hospital (Xiangya Hospital) of Changsha to facilitate the

rapid detection and quarantine of COVID- patients. Here we describe the
clinical practice of triaging patients in the epidemic of SARS-CoV-, along with
the clinical and laboratory characteristics of eight COVID- cases identified
from more than  suspected individuals with various symptoms triaged to the
section for patients without obvious epidemiological history.

METHODS
Triage and patients
This single-centre, retrospective, observational study was done at Xiangya
Hospital (Changsha, China). Patients with fever, respiratory symptoms, myalgia,
fatigue, or other symptoms possibly related to SARS-CoV- infection were
received at the triage reception between January  and February  before
being directed to the Section A or B based on epidemiological characteristics.
Patients, who met one of the following conditions within  days before illness
onset, were sorted to the Section A: (a) exposure to Hubei province or local
communities with confirmed COVID- cases reported; (b) exposure to patients
with similar symptoms from regions mentioned in (a); (c) exposure to known
COVID- patients; (d) association with clustering occurrence (Figure A).
Other patients were directed to the Section B.

Besides symptoms, clinical and laboratory characteristics suggestive for SARSCoV- infection are: (i) chest computed tomographic (CT) results with

pneumonia features; (ii) normal or reduced leucocyte count or reduced
lymphocyte count in early onset.,,, At the Section A, patients having mild
symptoms without both (i) and (ii) were recommended for home quarantine with
prescription. Others were quarantined to take oropharyngeal swab (if not
specified otherwise) for SARS-CoV- nucleic acid analysis by real-time reverse
transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). At the Section B, patients
with suspected chest CT characteristics (i) were also quarantined for nucleic
acid analysis. Others were further evaluated by doctor based on symptoms
(fever, respiratory symptoms, myalgia/fatigue, etc.), comorbidities, vital signs
and blood routine characteristics: patients with severe symptoms were
quarantined for treatment and nucleic acid analysis and were transferred to
relevant units for further treatment when diagnosed as negative for SARS-CoV infection; patients having mild symptoms without (ii) were recommended for
home quarantine with prescription, and the rest were submitted for nucleic acid
analysis and were recommended for home quarantine with prescription if
negative result of SARS-CoV- was obtained (the second nucleic acid test after
 hours was recommended and performed based on patient’s availability)
(Figure A). Self-quarantined patients were followed up by phone visiting.
Identified COVID- patients were immediately transferred to designated
hospitals for quarantine and treatment. All medical personnel working at both
sections and the triage reception were equipped with appropriate protections.
Suspected patients submitted for nucleic acid analysis at the Section B were

enrolled in this study. The Ethics Commission of Xiangya Hospital approved
this study (No. ). Written informed consent was waived due to the
rapid emergence of this infectious disease.

Data collection
Blood routine, biochemical, radiological and microbiological data together with
demographics, epidemiological characteristics, medical histories and vital signs
(body temperature, heart rate, respiratory rate, blood pressure, blood oxygen
saturation) of patients were collected from a local server. If data were missing
from the records or clarification was needed, data were obtained by direct
communication with patients, attending doctors, or other healthcare providers.
All data were checked by two physicians (W. Wang and G. Huang). Patients
with negative results of RT-PCR for SARS-CoV- infection were revisited by
phone when applicable.

Laboratory test
Clinical specimens for SARS-CoV- diagnostic test were obtained in
accordance with clinical guidelines. Oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal
swabs were collected with synthetic fiber swabs, maintained in - mL viraltransport medium and stored between  °C and  °C until ready for test. RNA
was extracted following the manufacture instruction (SANSURE). Laboratory
confirmation of SARS-CoV- was performed using real-time RT-PCR kit

following the manufacture instruction (SANSURE) on the ABI Q PCR machine.
Analysis for influenza A/B virus was performed using antigen detection reagent
(colloidal gold method). Routine bacterial examinations were also performed.

RESULTS
In total,  patients (visiting number) were received at the triage reception
(January –February ). Following the triage procedures,  visits were
directed to the Section A, and  COVID- cases (%, /) were confirmed.
In the first ten days of triage, confirmed cases were identified nearly every day
(Figure B). On the other side,  visits were directed to the Section B, and
eight cases (%, /) were confirmed (Table S). Seven of them were
spotted in the first ten days (Figure B). The implemented triage procedures
effectively enriched COVID- patients into the Section A and reduced the
possibility of transmitting the virus to other patients and medical stuff. During
the triaging period, the number of reported COVID- patients in Changsha
rapidly increased ten times (from  to ) and reached plateau after February
 (Figure B).

Of the  visits in the Section B,  individual patients were suspected, but
laboratory evidence did not support for SARS-CoV- infection. % (/)
of them did multiple rounds of nucleic acid test.  of  patients with contact
information were successfully followed up by phone visiting a few days after the

last nucleic acid test. None was reported as a COVID- case. % (/)
of the patients were phone visited more than a week after their last nucleic acid
test (Figure ). % (/) of them were double checked by additional medical
institutions.

Of the eight COVID- patients identified by the Section B, five (cases –)
were confirmed with SARS-CoV- infection after one round of nucleic acid
analysis (Figure  and Table S). Cases  and  had no obvious
epidemiological history. Cases ,  and  (a familial cluster) arrived at the
Section B initially without revealing both the contact history with people from
Wuhan on a family event as well as the common symptoms among themselves.
They were quarantined after the critical epidemiological information was given
to the doctor during diagnostic inquiry and were soon confirmed to be positive
for SARS-CoV- infection (Figure ). Case  was evaluated as suspected
COVID- case after arriving at the Section B (according to the chest CT
images provided by another hospital) and was quarantined for further diagnosis.
Nucleic acid analysis was performed on the first and the third day during
quarantine. The second analysis supported for the virus infection (Figure ).

Case  arrived from Wuhan on January  and was admitted into the hospital
in quarantine with cough, high fever and lymphopenia on January  before the
triaging period (Figure , Table S). The chest CT progress with the ground

glass shadow was consistent with the early imaging manifestation of viral
pneumonia (Figure S). Multiple rounds of nucleic acid analysis (at least 
hours apart) before and after being transferred to the Section B failed to detect
SARS-CoV- infection (Figure ). The clinical features of the patient aggravated
(Table S). Subsequently, sputum of the patient was induced by % hypertonic
saline nebulization and collected for RT-PCR analysis and the virus infection
was confirmed (Figure ). Of note, sputum-promoting operation was not
routinely performed, as the effect of aerosol transmission of the virus indoor is
of concern.

Before the epidemic alert, case  was admitted into the gastroenterology
department due to retching for three weeks. During hospitalization (January –
), other symptoms (shortness of breath, chest tightness), which were
concealed before by retching, were revealed to the medical staff. He was
diagnosed with polyserous effusions, constrictive pericarditis and lung infection
and was discharged because of the alleviation of the above symptoms (Figure
). Before triage, he visited the emergency department due to coughing. The
number of leucocytes and lymphocytes was in normal range (Table ). The
chest CT images on January  showed bilateral pleural effusion and
pericardial effusion (Figure A). On February , he was admitted to the ICU due
to severe coughing and dyspnea with normal blood cell count, no recent
suspicious epidemiological history, nor typical chest CT images of viral infection

(Figure B, Table ). Four days later, the chest CT images significantly changed
and indicated possible viral infection. He was directed to the Section B (Figure
C). However, the results from double nucleic acid analyses did not support for
SARS-CoV- infection (Figure ). Meanwhile, the symptoms (e.g. dyspnoea,
chest tightness) were relieved with supportive treatments. However, the
patient’s condition aggravated soon and he was sent into the emergency room.
Since the chest CT images still indicated possible viral infection, multiple rounds
of nucleic acid analysis were performed and confirmed SARS-CoV- infection
(Figures  and D). Of note, both oropharyngeal and nasopharyngeal swabs
were collected for nucleic acid analysis, but only the latter returned a positive
result for SARS-CoV-.

DISCUSSION
Our retrospective study describes the clinical practice of triaging patients based
on epidemiology in a local hospital of Changsha during the COVID- outbreak.
The triage procedures last for  days covering the rapid spreading phase of
SARS-CoV- in the city. Comparing to the situation of the Section B, patients
with the virus infection were concentrated seven folds into the Section A, which
was designated for rapid screening and quarantine. The first  days were
shown to be critical in reducing the chance of spreading SARS-CoV-. More
than % of COVID- patients were identified during this period.

Rapid identification and isolation of COVID- patients was key to control the
nosocomial infection, yet the pressure on Section B was still high. The virulence
of SARS-CoV- seems to be weaker than SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, but the
ability of transmission among humans is stronger. During the  days of triage,
roughly triple amounts of visits were received at the Section B as compared to
the Section A.  individuals were suspected and received careful
examination. More than % of them did multiple rounds of nucleic acid
analysis at least  hours apart for signs of SARS-CoV-. Eventually, eight
COVID- cases were confirmed. Revisiting the patients diagnosed as
negative for SARS-CoV- infection did not reveal that any COVID- patient
was missed. Besides different course and severity of illness, delayed sharing
of epidemiological history adds another layer of complexity to the diagnosis,
underlining thorough diagnostic inquiry.

Most COVID- patients were identified as positive with one or two rounds of
nucleic acid analysis in our study. Two cases (cases  and ) seemed to be
more complicated than usual. Case  arrived at the Section B with two negative
nucleic acid reports already. The course of chest CT images, haematological
features as well as previous Wuhan experience prompted three more rounds of
nucleic acid analysis and finally confirmed the SARS-CoV- infection using the
lower respiratory tract specimen. Case  had been enrolled into the hospital
multiple times starting before the epidemic was alerted. Though being

thoroughly examined, his comorbidities, no obvious recent epidemic history as
well as the initial two negative results of nucleic acid analysis interfered the
diagnosis. Accordingly, he was not in quarantine for treatment for roughly six
days in the triage period. We only learned during the retrospective study that
more than  people had returned to his town from Hubei province before
January . Although this piece of information could not serve as concrete
evidence for anything, it would have promoted the doctor to have second
thoughts when looking at his case. After being finally confirmed as a COVID-
case, overlapping patients along his track in the gastroenterology department
and in the ICU were revisited. More than ten patients regarded as close
contacts in the emergency department were quarantined for observation and
diagnosis. Relevant medical stuff was submitted to CT/nucleic acid analysis.
No one was found to be infected by SARS-CoV-. Several additional measures
were believed to contribute to this outcome: all patients were persuaded to
actively wear masks during treatment in hospital area; disinfection of the
hospital environment and medical stuff was implemented at least twice more
frequently than usual during this period.

So far, no specific medication is available to cure COVID-. Current clinical
treatment is mainly supportive. The globalization of economy has facilitated
the transmission of SARS-CoV- from one single city to six continents within
very short time. When the daily reported new COVID- cases have been

decreasing in China, they are continuously increasing in many other countries.
On March , the WHO has characterized COVID- as a pandemic. The
worldwide shortage of personal protective equipment has also been alerted.
Triage — a medical practice that can be traced back to Napoleon’s time — has
been integrated into daily practice in modern medical system. Yet, most
clinicians, if not all, have no direct experience in the context of fighting a novel
viral epidemic emergency. Our retrospective study of the triaging practice
together with the diagnostic and clinical course of eight COVID- patients from
 suspects will help other colleagues to control the transmission of the virus
in the current COVID- outbreak.
