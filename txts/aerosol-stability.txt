Aerosol and Surface Stability of SARS-CoV-2
as Compared with SARS-CoV-1
To the Editor: A novel human coronavirus that
is now named severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) (formerly called HCoV19) emerged in Wuhan, China, in late 2019 and
is now causing a pandemic.1 We analyzed the
aerosol and surface stability of SARS-CoV-2 and
compared it with SARS-CoV-1, the most closely
related human coronavirus.2
We evaluated the stability of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV-1 in aerosols and on various surfaces
and estimated their decay rates using a Bayesian
regression model (see the Methods section in the
Supplementary Appendix, available with the full
text of this letter at NEJM.org). SARS-CoV-2
nCoV-WA1-2020 (MN985325.1) and SARS-CoV-1
Tor2 (AY274119.3) were the strains used. Aerosols (<5 μm) containing SARS-CoV-2 (105.25 50%
tissue-culture infectious dose [TCID50] per milliliter) or SARS-CoV-1 (106.75-7.00 TCID50 per milliliter)
were generated with the use of a three-jet Collison nebulizer and fed into a Goldberg drum to
create an aerosolized environment. The inoculum resulted in cycle-threshold values between
20 and 22, similar to those observed in samples
obtained from the upper and lower respiratory
tract in humans.
Our data consisted of 10 experimental conditions involving two viruses (SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV-1) in five environmental conditions
(aerosols, plastic, stainless steel, copper, and cardboard). All experimental measurements are reported as means across three replicates.
SARS-CoV-2 remained viable in aerosols
throughout the duration of our experiment
(3 hours), with a reduction in infectious titer from
103.5 to 102.7 TCID50 per liter of air. This reduction
was similar to that observed with SARS-CoV-1,
from 104.3 to 103.5 TCID50 per milliliter (Fig. 1A).
SARS-CoV-2 was more stable on plastic and
stainless steel than on copper and cardboard, and
viable virus was detected up to 72 hours after application to these surfaces (Fig. 1A), although
the virus titer was greatly reduced (from 103.7 to

100.6 TCID50 per milliliter of medium after 72 hours
on plastic and from 103.7 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel). The stability kinetics of SARS-CoV-1 were similar (from
103.4 to 100.7 TCID50 per milliliter after 72 hours
on plastic and from 103.6 to 100.6 TCID50 per milliliter after 48 hours on stainless steel). On copper,
no viable SARS-CoV-2 was measured after 4 hours
and no viable SARS-CoV-1 was measured after
8 hours. On cardboard, no viable SARS-CoV-2 was
measured after 24 hours and no viable SARSCoV-1 was measured after 8 hours (Fig. 1A).
Both viruses had an exponential decay in virus titer across all experimental conditions, as
indicated by a linear decrease in the log10TCID50
per liter of air or milliliter of medium over time
(Fig. 1B). The half-lives of SARS-CoV-2 and
SARS-CoV-1 were similar in aerosols, with median estimates of approximately 1.1 to 1.2 hours
and 95% credible intervals of 0.64 to 2.64 for
SARS-CoV-2 and 0.78 to 2.43 for SARS-CoV-1
(Fig. 1C, and Table S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). The half-lives of the two viruses were
also similar on copper. On cardboard, the halflife of SARS-CoV-2 was longer than that of SARSCoV-1. The longest viability of both viruses was
on stainless steel and plastic; the estimated median half-life of SARS-CoV-2 was approximately
5.6 hours on stainless steel and 6.8 hours on
plastic (Fig. 1C). Estimated differences in the halflives of the two viruses were small except for
those on cardboard (Fig. 1C). Individual replicate
data were noticeably “noisier” (i.e., there was
more variation in the experiment, resulting in a
larger standard error) for cardboard than for
other surfaces (Fig. S1 through S5), so we advise
caution in interpreting this result.
We found that the stability of SARS-CoV-2
was similar to that of SARS-CoV-1 under the experimental circumstances tested. This indicates
that differences in the epidemiologic characteristics of these viruses probably arise from other
factors, including high viral loads in the upper

Figure 1 (facing page). Viability of SARS-CoV-1 and
SARS-CoV-2 in Aerosols and on Various Surfaces.
As shown in Panel A, the titer of aerosolized viable
virus is expressed in 50% tissue-culture infectious
dose (TCID50) per liter of air. Viruses were applied to
copper, cardboard, stainless steel, and plastic maintained at 21 to 23°C and 40% relative humidity over
7 days. The titer of viable virus is expressed as TCID50
per milliliter of collection medium. All samples were
quantified by end-point titration on Vero E6 cells.
Plots show the means and standard errors (I bars)
across three replicates. As shown in Panel B, regression plots indicate the predicted decay of virus titer
over time; the titer is plotted on a logarithmic scale.
Points show measured titers and are slightly jittered
(i.e., they show small rapid variations in the amplitude or timing of a waveform arising from fluctuations) along the time axis to avoid overplotting. Lines
are random draws from the joint posterior distribution of the exponential decay rate (negative of the
slope) and intercept (initial virus titer) to show the
range of possible decay patterns for each experimental condition. There were 150 lines per panel, including 50 lines from each plotted replicate. As shown in
Panel C, violin plots indicate posterior distribution for
the half-life of viable virus based on the estimated exponential decay rates of the virus titer. The dots indicate the posterior median estimates, and the black
lines indicate a 95% credible interval. Experimental
conditions are ordered according to the posterior median half-life of SARS-CoV-2. The dashed lines indicate
the limit of detection, which was 3.33×10 0.5 TCID50
per liter of air for aerosols, 10 0.5 TCID50 per milliliter
of medium for plastic, steel, and cardboard, and 101.5
TCID50 per milliliter of medium for copper.

respiratory tract and the potential for persons
infected with SARS-CoV-2 to shed and transmit
the virus while asymptomatic.3,4 Our results indicate that aerosol and fomite transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 is plausible, since the virus can remain viable and infectious in aerosols for hours
and on surfaces up to days (depending on the
inoculum shed). These findings echo those with
SARS-CoV-1, in which these forms of transmission
were associated with nosocomial spread and super-spreading events,5 and they provide information for pandemic mitigation efforts.
