Abstract
Crohn’s disease (CD)] and ulcerative colitis (UC), the main inflammatory bowel diseases
(IBD) in human beings, are chronic, immune-inflammatory diseases, whose pathogenesis

These disabling conditions affect millions of individuals and, together with the drugs used to

cr
ip

t

treat them, can put patients at risk of developing complications and other conditions. This is
particularly relevant nowadays, as coronavirus disease (Covid-) has rapidly spread from
China to countries where IBD are more prevalent and there is convincing evidence that

us

Covid--mediated morbidity and mortality are higher in subjects with comorbidities. The

an

primary objectives of this Viewpoint are to provide a focused overview of the factors and
mechanisms by which the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-

M

CoV-) infects the cells and to illustrate the link between such determinants and the intestinal
inflammation. We also provide clues about the reasons why the overall IBD population might

ed

have no increased risk to be infected with SARS-CoV- and highlight the potential of

cytokine blockers, used to treat IBD patients, to prevent Covid-driven pneumonia.

experts agree that the IBD-associated tissue damage is driven by an excessive immune

response against luminal bacteria arising in genetically-predisposed individuals as a result of
the action of multiple environmental factors (). These disabling conditions affect millions of

individuals and have variable presentations and courses, which, together with the medications
used to treat them, can put patients at risk of developing complications and other conditions

(). Nowadays there is an increasing concern about the risk that IBD patients have to be

M

infected with the novel severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus  (SARS-CoV-).
Indeed, after the initial cases diagnosed in Wuhan (China) in December , coronavirus

disease (Covid-) has rapidly spread to countries where IBD are more prevalent and it is
now clear that comorbidities are associated with poorer clinical outcome in patients with

Covid- ().

Why should IBD patients be at increased risk for SARS-CoV--induced infections?

Ac

Coronaviruses bind to their target cells through angiotensin-converting enzyme  (ACE), a
monocarboxypeptidase best known for cleaving several peptides within the renin-angiotensin
system and other substrates (). ACE is constitutively expressed by epithelial cells of the
lung, intestine, kidney, and blood vessels, and is present in the terminal ileum and colon in
concentrations that are amongst the highest in the body (). Analysis of the distribution of
SARS-CoV- among different biological samples of patients with Covid- showed that up
to % of the faecal samples were positive (, ). Moreover, more than one fifth of the
patients remained positive in stools after showing negative in respiratory samples (). These

Although the cause of inflammatory bowel diseases (IBD) remains unknown, most

Manuscript Doi: ./ecco-jcc/jjaa
findings could explain why some Covid- patients experience gastrointestinal symptoms
and would imply that SARS-CoV- can spread through the faecal route. The expression of
ACE is increased in inflamed gut of patients with IBD (). Moreover, proteomic analysis of

disease (CD) than in ulcerative colitis (UC) (). Along with binding to ACE, fusion of the

cr
ip

t

coronavirus envelope with host cell membranes is critical for establishing a successful
infection. This process is mediated by a specific fusion, or “spike” protein (), which is
activated though a proteolytic cleavage induced by host cell trypsin-like proteases, whose

us

activity has been reported to be up-regulated in IBD (). These observations suggest that the

an

inflamed gut of IBD patients represents an optimal doorway through which the virus enters
human tissues. However, based on a PubMed search on March , , we found no

M

evidence to suggest that Covid- occurs more frequently in IBD than in the general
population. Moreover, so far, no IBD patient with SARS-CoV- infection has been reported

ed

from the tertiary IBD centres in Wuhan.

How can we interpret these findings? There are two functional and distinct forms of
ACE. The full-length ACE contains an extracellular domain, which acts as a receptor for
the spike protein of SARS-CoV-, and a structural transmembrane domain, which anchors

Ac

the extracellular domain to the plasma membrane () In contrast, the soluble form of ACE
lacks the membrane anchor and circulates in small amounts in the blood (). In vitro studies
have shown that the latter form of ACE might act as a competitive interceptor of SARSCoV- by preventing binding of the viral particle to the surface-bound, full-length ACE
(). Notably, the level of the soluble ACE is up-regulated in the peripheral blood of IBD
patients (), raising the possibility that this isoform could contribute to limit SARS-CoV-
infection.

tissue samples of IBD patients revealed a significantly higher expression of ACE in Crohn’s

Manuscript Doi: ./ecco-jcc/jjaa
Although the live SARS-CoV- is detectable in faeces (), there is no clear-cut
evidence that the content of ACE in the ileum and colon influences entry and replication of
the virus within the intestinal cells and, hence, facilitates its transmission by an extra-

attachment-promoting factors to ensure robust infection of host cells. This is in line with the

modest ACE expression in the upper respiratory tract ().

demonstration that SARS-CoV- spreads rapidly through the respiratory route despite the

us

Another aspect relevant for the Covid- infection in IBD relates to the current
therapy, as many patients are taking immunesuppressors (e.g. azathioprine, methotrexate) for

an

inducing and maintaining remission as well as preventing IBD-associated complications. The
use of such compounds has been associated with increased risk of infections as they block

M

intracellular signals needed for the host to fight pathogens (). On the other hand, it is

ed

noteworthy that suppression of the effector cytokine driven-inflammatory response in IBD
(e.g. using cytokine blockers) could be beneficial not only for dampening the ongoing

ce
pt

mucosal inflammation but also for preventing Covid--driven pneumonia. Indeed, the
profile of cytokines documented in patients with severe Covid- resembles that seen in
inflamed intestine of IBD patients and during the “cytokine storm” syndrome, a life-threating

Ac

condition characterized by hyper-activation of T cells and massive production of interleukin
(IL)-, IL-, TNF, and interferon-. Consistently, blockers of IL- or IL- have been
used with success in pathologies characterized by cytokine storm and preliminary evidence
supports the use of IL- receptor antagonists in the treatment of Covid--driven pneumonia
().
The overall available evidence suggests that IBD patients do not have increased risk
to develop Covid- and should stay on IBD medications. Patients receiving
