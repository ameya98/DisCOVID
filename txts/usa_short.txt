Background Coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is a disease caused by severe acute respiratory syndrome
coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), first detected in China in December, 2019. In January, 2020, state, local, and federal
public health agencies investigated the first case of COVID-19 in Illinois, USA.
Methods Patients with confirmed COVID-19 were defined as those with a positive SARS-CoV-2 test. Contacts were
people with exposure to a patient with COVID-19 on or after the patient’s symptom onset date. Contacts underwent
active symptom monitoring for 14 days following their last exposure. Contacts who developed fever, cough, or
shortness of breath became persons under investigation and were tested for SARS-CoV-2. A convenience sample of
32 asymptomatic health-care personnel contacts were also tested.
Findings Patient 1—a woman in her 60s—returned from China in mid-January, 2020. One week later, she was
hospitalised with pneumonia and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Her husband (Patient 2) did not travel but had
frequent close contact with his wife. He was admitted 8 days later and tested positive for SARS-CoV-2. Overall,
372 contacts of both cases were identified; 347 underwent active symptom monitoring, including 152 community
contacts and 195 health-care personnel. Of monitored contacts, 43 became persons under investigation, in addition to
Patient 2. These 43 persons under investigation and all 32 asymptomatic health-care personnel tested negative for
SARS-CoV-2.
