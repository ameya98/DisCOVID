Introduction
In late December 2019, an outbreak of an unknown disease called pneumonia of
unknown cause occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China1. The outbreak has
spread substantial to infect 9720 people in China with 213 deaths and to infect 106
people in 19 other countries up to January 31, 2020
(https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/2020013
1-sitrep-11-ncov.pdf). A few days later, the causative agent of this mysterious
pneumonia was identified as a novel coronavirus by several independent
laboratories2-4. The causative virus has been temporarily named as severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) and the relevant infected
disease has been named as coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World
Health Organization respectively. According to the daily report of the World
Health Organization, the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 so far registered 78630 cases
and 2747 deaths in China, spread to 46 other countries that reported a total of
3664 cases by February 27, 2020
(https://www.who.int/docs/default-source/coronaviruse/situation-reports/2020022
7-sitrep-38-covid-19.pdf). COVID-19 epidemic has become a global health threat.

Coronaviruses are a group of highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense,
single-stranded RNA viruses5. They cause several diseases involving respiratory,
enteric, hepatic and neurological systems with vary severity among humans and

animals5,6. Human coronavirus (CoV) infections have traditionally caused a low
percentage of annual respiratory infections. There are HCoV-OC43, HCoV-229E,
HCoV-NL63 and HCoV-HKU1, which cause mild respiratory illness5,7. Over the
past two decades, two novel coronaviruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome
CoV (SARS-CoV) and Middle East respiratory syndrome CoV (MERS-CoV),
have emerged and cause severe human diseases8,9. During the epidemic,
SARS-CoV infect more than 8000 people worldwide with nearly 800 fatalities,
representing its mortality rate around 10%. Whereas MERS-CoV infected over
857 official cases and 334 deaths, making its mortality rate approximately
35%10-12. So far, SARS-CoV-2 is the seventh member of the family of
coronaviruses that infects humans. The main symptoms of COVID-19 included
fever, fatigue, and cough, which are similar to that of SARS-CoV and
MERS-CoV infected cases. There are some overlapping and discrete aspects of
the pathology and pathogenesis of these coronaviruses which cause severe
diseases in humans13.
Many literatures reported the clinical features, virology, pathology and radiology
of COVID-19, but the comprehensive review is few. The purpose of this review is
primarily to review the pathogen, clinical features, diagnosis, and treatment of
COVID-19, but also to comment briefly on the epidemiology and pathology based
on the current evidences.

The pathogen
The pathogen that causes COVID-19 is a novel coronavirus that was first
identified in the late January 2020, named SARS-CoV-2 (also known as

Accepted Article

2019-nCoV)2-4.
SARS-CoV-2 is a novel member of coronaviruses, which are a large group of
highly diverse, enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA viruses5. Recent
research reported that SARS-CoV-2 likely originated in bats, based on the
similarity of its genetic sequence to that of other coronaviruses14. The intermediate
animal host of SARS-CoV-2 between a probable bat reservoir and humans is still
unknown15. Although this novel coronavirus has genetic features that are
compatible with the family of coronavirus, nevertheless it has distinct gene
sequences that are significantly different from previously sequenced coronaviruses
(Table 1). The analysis of samples from seven SARS-CoV-2 infected patients
suggested that SARS-CoV-2 shares 79.5% sequence identity to SARS-CoV3.
Simplot analysis showed that SARS-CoV-2 share 96.2% overall genome sequence
identity to RaTG13, which is a short RdRp region from a bat coronavirus3.
Phylogenetic analysis revealed that SARS-CoV-2 falls into the subgenus
Sarbecovirus of the genus Betacoronavirus and is distinct from SARS-CoV2,4.
The envelope spike (S) protein is important for coronavirus16. The S protein
mediates receptor binding and membrane fusion and is crucial for determining
host tropism and transmission capacity17-19. Generally, the S protein is
functionally divided into the S1 domain, responsible for receptor binding, and S2
domain, responsible for cell membrane fusion20. Structure analysis suggested that
receptor-binding domain was composed of a core and an external subdomain16.
Angiotensin converting enzyme II (ACE2) was known as cell receptor for
SARS-CoV21-23. Similar to SARS-CoV, SARS-CoV-2 also use ACE2 as an entry

receptor in the ACE2-expressing cells3, indicating SARS-CoV-2 may share the
same life cycle with SARS-CoV (Figure 1).
The biophysical and structural analysis indicated that S protein of SARS-CoV-2

Accepted Article

binds ACE2 with approximately10- to 20- fold higher affinity than S protein of
SARS-CoV24. The high affinity of S protein for human ACE2 may facilitate the
spread of SARS-CoV-2 in human populations. Meanwhile, SARS-CoV-2 does not
use other coronavirus receptors, such as aminopeptidase N and dipeptidyl
peptidase 4 (DPP4) to enter cells3.
Epidemiology
Briefly, cases tend to be in clusters which arrive in waves, and develop into larger
outbreaks all over the world. The first documented outbreak occurred primarily in
Wuhan, China1. According to the daily report of the World Health Organization,
the epidemic of SARS-CoV-2 so far registered 78630 cases and 2747 deaths in
China, spread to 46 other countries that reported a total of 3664 cases by February
27th, 2020.
There are evidences suggest that transmission mode is human to human25,26. The
major route of transmission of COVID-19 is droplet and close contact26. Whether
infection can occur through the oral or conjunctival routes is unknown, but
SARS-CoV-2 has been detected in tears27, which is resemble to SARS-CoV28.
Reproductive number (R0) was estimated by some studies. Based on the clinical
data of patients in COVID-19 early outbreak, the mean R0 was ranging from 2.20
to 3.58, meaning that each patient has been spreading infection to 2 or 3 other
people25,29. It is still too early to develop an accurate R0 estimate or to assess the
dynamics of transmission. More research is needed in the future.

The mean incubation period is about 5 days, ranging from 1-14 days and 95% of
patients are likely to experience symptoms within 12.5 days of contact25,30. These
data suggest a 14-day medical observation period or quarantine for exposed and

Accepted Article

close contact persons. However, an asymptomatic carrier was reported and the
incubation period was 19 days, suggesting the complicated challenge to contain
the outbreak31.
Clinical features
Most case patients were 30-79 years of age32. The median age is ranging from 49
to 59 years25,26,33,34. There were few cases in children below 15 years of age. More
than half the patients were male. Nearly half the cases had one or more coexisting
medical conditions, such as hypertension, diabetes and cardiovascular
disease25,26,33,34. A large cases study indicated that the case-fatality rate was
elevated among those patients with coexisting medical conditions32.
The spectrum of clinical presentations of COVID-19 have been reported ranging
from asymptomatic infection to severe respiratory failure25,26,30,32-34. The main
symptoms include a self-reported fever, fatigue, dry cough, myalgia, and dyspnea.
The uncommon symptoms include sputum production, headache, hemoptysis and
diarrhea25,26,30,32-34. Although pneumonia is present in most SARS-CoV-2 infected
patients, few cases complained of pleuritic chest pain26,33.
According to the severity of symptoms, patients can be classified as mild, severe,
and critical types32(Table 2). Mild patients had nonpneumonia or mild pneumonia.
Severe patients had several clinical findings, including dyspnea, respiratory
frequency ≥ 30/min, blood oxygen saturation ≤ 93%, partial pressure of arterial
oxygen to fraction of inspired oxygen ratio < 300, and/or lung infiltrates >50%
within 24 to 48 hours. Critical patients had severe conditions, such as respiratory

failure, septic shock, and/or multiple organ dysfunction or failure32. If the disease
progressed, the median duration period from illness onset to dyspnea was 8.0
days, and to mechanical ventilation was 10.5 days34.

Accepted Article

Common clinical laboratory findings include leucopenia and
lymphopenia25,30,33,34. Lymphopenia is a cardinal feature of COVID-19. Lactate
dehydrogenase, and creatinine kinase are all elevated. Half of patients had
abnormal liver function, with elevated alanine aminotransferase or aspartate
aminotransferase. Most patients had abnormal myocardial zymogram, which
showed the elevation of creatine kinase and lactate dehydrogenase. Most patients
showed normal serum levels of procalcitonim, but the C-reactive protein was
above the normal range. One third of patients had the elevation of
D-dimer25,30,33,34.
One study investigated the changes of several cytokines in serum in the
COVID-19 patients34. Initial plasma IL1B, IL1RA, IL7, IL8, IL9, IL10, basic
FGF, GCSF, GMCSF, IFNγ, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, MIP1B, PDGF, TNFα, and
VEGF concentrations were higher in patients than in healthy adults. Plasma levels
of IL5, IL12p70, IL15, Eotaxin, and RANTES were similar between patients and
healthy adults. Further comparison between intensive care unit (ICU) and
non-ICU patients showed that plasma concentrations of IL2, IL7, IL10, GCSF,
IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNFα were higher in ICU patients than non-ICU
patients34. These findings suggested that the initiation of the immune response
result in the production of chemokines and cytokines, which damage normal host
lung.
The radiologic manifestations of SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are diverse and
progressing rapidly35-38. Two third of patients had at least two affected lobes,
nearly half of patients had five affected lobes37,38. The most common

manifestations are patchy ground glass opacities (GGO) and patchy consolidation
which were mainly distributed in the middle and outer zone of the lung37,38
(Figure 2). A little fibrous stripe may appear if the condition was improved37. One

Accepted Article

report suggested that there are four stages defined on CT scan36. In early stage,
GGO was the main radiological demonstration distributed in the lower lobes
unilaterally or bilaterally. In progressive stage, diffuse and bilateral GGO and
consolidation in more than two lobes became the main manifestation. In peak
stage, the diffuse GGO and dense consolidation became more prevalent. In
absorption stage, extensive GGO could be observed and the consolidation was
gradually absorbed.
Pathology
The pathological findings of human SARS-CoV-2 infection have been limited due
to the rare number of biopsies or autopsies. In a case reported by Xu et al. a
50-year old man died 14 days after admission due to respiratory failure and
cardiac arrest39. The primary finding of biopsy at autopsy was bilateral diffuse
alveolar damage with cellular fibromyxoid exudates and interstitial mononuclear
inflammatory infiltrates dominated by lymphocytes. Multinucleated syncytial cells
with atypical enlarged pneumocytes characterized by large nuclei, amphophilic
granular cytoplasm, and prominent nucleoli were identified in the intraalveolar
spaces, showing viral cytopathic-like changes. No obvious intranuclear or
intracytoplasmic viral inclusions were identified. These pathological features
show great similarities to SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV infection40-42. In addition,
liver and heart were studied. There is moderate microvascular steatosis and mild
lobular and portal activity in the liver tissue and a few interstitial mononuclear
inflammatory infiltrates in the heart tissue.

Diagnosis
Although a good contact history, systemic symptoms, and radiographic changes of
pneumonia make the diagnosis likely, the laboratory diagnosis is more reliable.

Accepted Article

RT-PCR is routinely used to detect causative viruses from respiratory
secretions43,44. During COVID-19 transmission events, RT-PCR has served as the
primary clinical laboratory diagnostic test25,26,30,33. Success of these tests are very
important to understand the viral kinetics and tissue tropism found in COVID-19
cases. Several specific and sensitive assays targeting RdRP, N, and E genes of the
SARS-CoV-2 genome were designed to detect viral RNA in clinical specimens44.
Lower respiratory tract samples provide the higher viral loads45. The sampling
source or operation may affect RT-PCR testing results43.
The positive rate of RT-PCR for throat swab samples was reported to be about
60% in early stage of COVID-1946. These findings suggested that the result of
RT-PCR should be interpret with caution. One study investigated the diagnostic
value and consistency of chest CT compared with RT-PCR test in 1014 patients
with suspected SARS-CoV-2 infection. The results suggest that the sensitivity of
chest CT in suspected patients was 97% based on positive RT-PCR result and
75% based on negative RT-PCR results. These findings indicated that chest CT is
a sensitive modality to detect SARS-CoV-2 infection.
During the COVID-19 epidemic in China, 10567 patients were diagnosed as
clinical diagnosed cases. This designation is being used in Hubei Province, where
is the worst affected area in China. In these cases, no RT-PCR test was performed
but diagnosis was made based on typical symptoms, exposure history, and chest
CT manifestations consistent with COVID-19 pneumonia. Under this criteria,
10567 cases were diagnosed and isolated. This strategy quarantined a large
number of suspected people and protected the healthy people to the most extent.

that are in shortage of RT-PCR testing kits to control the COVID-19 epidemic.
Treatment
Until the diagnosis is confirmed, SARS-CoV-2 infected patients are treated in
single rooms25,30.As SARS-CoV-2 is an emerging virus, an effective antiviral
treatment has not been identified. The main treatment of COVID-19 is
symptomatic treatment. The antiviral drugs, including oseltamivir, ribavirin,
ganciclovir, lopinavir, and ritonavir have been used in attempts to reduce viral
load and to prevent the likelihood of respiratory complications in several
studies25,26,30,33,34. Remdesivir was reported in the treatment of a patient with
COVID-19 in the United States and got an effective result47. However, the
efficacy of these antiviral drugs for COVID-19 need to be verified by randomized,
controlled clinical trials.
The antibiotics used generally covered common pathogens and some atypical
pathogens. When secondary bacterial infection occurred, medication was
administered according to the results of bacterial culture and drug sensitivity33.
Current evidence in patients with SARS and MERS suggests that receiving
corticosteroids did not have a survival benefit, but rather delayed viral
clearance48-50. Therefore, routine corticosteroids should be avoided unless they are
indicated for other reason. Arbidol is used empirically in China because of its
direct antiviral effect on SARS-CoV in cell culture51. Chinese herbal medicine
formulae are used to prevent SARS-CoV-2 infection in 23 provinces in China52.

Noninvasive or mechanical ventilation should be considered in patients with
hypoxia despite oxygen supplement and worsening shortness of breath.
Extrcorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) is used as a last resort30,33,34.

Prognosis
As of February 27, 2020, a total of 2747 deaths in China and 57 deaths outside of
China have been reported. The number of laboratory-confirmed cases and deaths
continues to rise. The current reported mortality for COVID-19 is approximately
3.41% compared with 10% for SARS and 35% for MERS10-12,53. The mortality
rate was higher than 3.41% in Iran and France, lower in Italy, Japan, Republic of
Korea, and United States (Figure 3). Considering the quick spread of COVID-19,
It is still too early to assess the mortality. All countries in the world should
respond to the epidemic effectively. Approximately 20% to 25% SARS-CoV-2
infected patients developed ARDS and required ICU care30,33,34. Current evidence
indicated that older age and comorbidity may be risk factors for poor outcome30.
Summary and outlook
This review summarizes the current findings of SARS-CoV-2 along with the
treatment for this severe coronavirus infection. The most common symptoms were
addressed. Due to the only biopsy report, the pathological findings associated with
SARS-CoV-2 infection have been limited. Autopsy is warranted and valuable for
future research.
The WHO issued a public health emergency of international concern on January
30, 2020. SARS-CoV-2 epidemic is becoming a global concern. At the moment
there is no vaccine and no specific treatment for COVID-19. The best strategy to
deal with SARS-CoV-2 epidemic includes controlling the sources of infection,
protecting the susceptible people, and cutting off the transmission. The infected

patients should be identified early by rapid and robust detection technologies,
provided with optimized treatment in isolation timely. The close contact people
should be quarantined with follow-up. The healthy people should be aware of the

Accepted Article

severity of COVID-19 and take measures to protect themselves, such as staying at
home, limiting social contacts, and wearing protective mask in public. The
authorities should encourage people to stay at home; discourage mass gathering;
postpone or cancel public events; and close public institutions. These control
measures will help COVID-19 infected countries to prevent the epidemic
effectively. Future research will focus on improving the accuracy of early
diagnostic tests, developing the vaccine and identifying effective drugs. Therefore,
elucidating the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV-2 infection is imperative for achieving
such goals.
