Lei Fang and colleagues1 postulate
that because severe acute respiratory
syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2)
binds to the angiotensin-converting
enzyme 2 (ACE2) receptor to facilitate
host cell entry,2,3 disease severity and
mortality of coronavirus disease 2019
(COVID-19) might be increased in
patients taking angiotensin converting
enzyme inhibitors (ACEIs) and
angiotensin receptor blockers (ARBs)
during the COVID-19 pandemic,
because the ACE2 receptor might be
upregulated with use of ACEIs and
ARBs.
Although it is true that many
patients with severe COVID-19
have hypertension and diabetes, as
reported by Guan and colleagues in a
study of more than 1000 patients,4
in that study other factors were also
notably unevenly distributed among
groups, including age, sex, smoking
status (eg, current smoker), and
chronic pulmonary disease. Even
though patients with diabetes and
hypertension frequently use ACEIs
and ARBs, many confounders must
be accounted for when interpreting
findings of observational studies.5 In
another study looking at risk factors
for mortality among patients with
COVID-19,6 despite hypertension and
diabetes being identified as the most
frequently associated comorbidities,
after multivariate regression the
association between these disorders
and COVID-19 mortality was no longer
significant.

In theory, use of ACEIs and ARBs over
time would result in an upregulation of
ACE2 receptors. In children and young
adults, ACE2 receptors are present at
a much higher density in lung tissue
than in older individuals. Thus, the
condition in people taking ACEIs
and ARBs emulates that in young
people. It is possible that having more
ACE2 receptors provides a reserve
against target-mediated destruction
by SARS-CoV-2.7 ACE2 functions to
produce the hepta­peptide angiotensin
(1-7), which has favourable effects
on the pulmonary endothelium
and might provide resilience from
development of pulmonary failure in
COVID-19.7
We caution against indiscriminate
discontinuation of ACEIs and ARBs
in patients who rely on these drugs
for treatment of heart failure and
who, additionally, might benefit
from the postulated positive effects
during overwhelming infection with
SARS-CoV-2. Discontinuation of ACEIs
or ARBs is associated with readmission
to hospital and mortality among
patients with heart failure.8 A surge of
admissions to hospital for heart failure
because of indiscriminate cessation of
these important agents could overload
already burdened health-care systems
with vulnerable patients and cause
diagnostic problems in view of the
range of symptoms shared between
acute heart failure and COVID-19, such
as cough and shortness of breath.
The quick developing nature of the
COVID-19 pandemic, and uncertainty
around best practice, calls for caution
when putting forward hypotheses

that suggest a change in drugs. More
evidence is needed before any clinical
decisions are made.
We declare no competing interests.
