BACKGROUND

No therapeutics have yet been proven effective for the treatment of severe illness
caused by SARS-CoV-2.
METHODS

We conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label trial involving hospitalized
adult patients with confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection, which causes the respiratory
illness Covid-19, and an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of 94% or less while they were
breathing ambient air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen (Pao2) to the
fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2) of less than 300 mm Hg. Patients were randomly
assigned in a 1:1 ratio to receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg,
respectively) twice a day for 14 days, in addition to standard care, or standard care
alone. The primary end point was the time to clinical improvement, defined as the
time from randomization to either an improvement of two points on a seven-category
ordinal scale or discharge from the hospital, whichever came first.

RESULTS

A total of 199 patients with laboratory-confirmed SARS-CoV-2 infection underwent
randomization; 99 were assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group, and 100 to the
standard-care group. Treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir was not associated with a
difference from standard care in the time to clinical improvement (hazard ratio for
clinical improvement, 1.24; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.90 to 1.72). Mortality
at 28 days was similar in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and the standard-care group
(19.2% vs. 25.0%; difference, −5.8 percentage points; 95% CI, −17.3 to 5.7). The percentages of patients with detectable viral RNA at various time points were similar. In
a modified intention-to-treat analysis, lopinavir–ritonavir led to a median time to
clinical improvement that was shorter by 1 day than that observed with standard
care (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI, 1.00 to 1.91). Gastrointestinal adverse events were
more common in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, but serious adverse events were
more common in the standard-care group. Lopinavir–ritonavir treatment was
stopped early in 13 patients (13.8%) because of adverse events.
CONCLUSIONS

In hospitalized adult patients with severe Covid-19, no benefit was observed with lopinavir–ritonavir treatment beyond standard care. Future trials in patients with severe
illness may help to confirm or exclude the possibility of a treatment benefit. (Funded

eginning in December 2019, a novel
coronavirus, designated SARS-CoV-2, has
caused an international outbreak of respiratory illness termed Covid-19. The full spectrum
of Covid-19 ranges from mild, self-limiting respiratory tract illness to severe progressive pneumonia, multiorgan failure, and death.1-4 Thus far,
there are no specific therapeutic agents for coronavirus infections. After the emergence of severe
acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003, screening of approved drugs identified lopinavir, a
human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) type 1
aspartate protease inhibitor, as having in vitro
inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV, the virus
that causes SARS in humans.5-7 Ritonavir is combined with lopinavir to increase its plasma halflife through the inhibition of cytochrome P450.
An open-label study published in 2004 suggested,
by comparison with a historical control group
that received only ribavirin, that the addition of
lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and 100 mg, respectively) to ribavirin reduced the risk of adverse
clinical outcomes (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS] or death) as well as viral load
among patients with SARS.5 However, the lack of
randomization and a contemporary control group
and the concomitant use of glucocorticoids and
ribavirin in that study made the effect of lopinavir–ritonavir difficult to assess. Similarly, lopinavir has activity, both in vitro8 and in an animal
model,9 against Middle East respiratory syndrome
coronavirus (MERS-CoV), and case reports have
suggested that the combination of lopinavir–ritonavir with ribavirin and interferon alfa resulted in
virologic clearance and survival.10-12 However, because convincing data about the efficacy of this
approach in humans are lacking,12 a clinical trial
(with recombinant interferon beta-1b) for MERS
is currently under way (ClinicalTrials.gov number,
NCT02845843).13-15
To evaluate the efficacy and safety of oral
lopinavir–ritonavir for SARS-CoV-2 infection, we
conducted a randomized, controlled, open-label
trial, LOTUS China (Lopinavir Trial for Suppression of SARS-Cov-2 in China), in adult patients
hospitalized with Covid-19.

for Disease Control (CDC) or by a designated diagnostic laboratory. Male and nonpregnant female
patients 18 years of age or older were eligible if
they had a diagnostic specimen that was positive
on RT-PCR, had pneumonia confirmed by chest
imaging, and had an oxygen saturation (Sao2) of
94% or less while they were breathing ambient
air or a ratio of the partial pressure of oxygen
(Pao2) to the fraction of inspired oxygen (Fio2)
(Pao2:Fio2) at or below 300 mg Hg. Exclusion
criteria included a physician decision that involvement in the trial was not in the patient’s best interest, presence of any condition that would not
allow the protocol to be followed safely, known
allergy or hypersensitivity to lopinavir–ritonavir,
known severe liver disease (e.g., cirrhosis, with
an alanine aminotransferase level >5× the upper
limit of the normal range or an aspartate aminotransferase level >5× the upper limit of the normal range), use of medications that are contraindicated with lopinavir–ritonavir and that could
not be replaced or stopped during the trial period (see the Supplementary Appendix, available
with the full text of this article at NEJM.org);
pregnancy or breast-feeding, or known HIV infection, because of concerns about the development
of resistance to lopinavir–ritonavir if used without
combining with other antiretrovirals. Patients who
were unable to swallow received lopinavir–ritonavir
through a nasogastric tube.
Trial Design and Oversight

This was an open-label, individually randomized,
controlled trial conducted from January 18, 2020,
through February 3, 2020 (the date of enrollment of the last patient), at Jin Yin-Tan Hospital,
Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. Because of the
emergency nature of the trial, placebos of lopinavir–ritonavir were not prepared. Eligible patients were randomly assigned in a 1:1 ratio to
receive either lopinavir–ritonavir (400 mg and
100 mg, orally; freely provided by the national
health authority) twice daily, plus standard care,
or standard care alone, for 14 days. Standard care

was stratified on the basis of respiratory support
methods at the time of enrollment: no oxygen
support or oxygen support with nasal duct or
mask, or high-flow oxygen, noninvasive ventilation, or invasive ventilation including ECMO. The
permuted block (four patients per block) randomization sequence, including stratification, was
prepared by a statistician not involved in the trial,
using SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute). To
minimize allocation bias, we performed allocation
concealment with an interactive Web-based response system until randomization was finished
on the system through a computer or phone.
The trial was approved by the institutional
review board of Jin Yin-Tan Hospital. Written
informed consent was obtained from all patients
or from the patient’s legal representative if the
patient was too unwell to provide consent. The
trial was conducted in accordance with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki and the
Good Clinical Practice guidelines of the International Conference on Harmonisation. The authors
were responsible for designing the trial and for
compiling and analyzing the data. The authors
vouch for the completeness and accuracy of the
data and for the adherence of the trial to the protocol. Full details about the trial design are provided in the protocol, available at NEJM.org.
Clinical and Laboratory Monitoring

tained for all 199 patients who were still alive at
every time point. Sampling did not stop when a
swab at a given time point was negative. Baseline
throat swabs were tested for detection of E gene,
RdRp gene, and N gene, and samples on the subsequent visits were quantitatively and qualitatively
detected for E gene. Clinical data were recorded on
paper case record forms and then double-entered
into an electronic database and validated by trial
staff.
Outcome Measures

The primary end point was the time to clinical
improvement, defined as the time from randomization to an improvement of two points (from
the status at randomization) on a seven-category
ordinal scale or live discharge from the hospital,
whichever came first. The end point of clinical
improvement was used in our previous influenza
study17 and was also recommended by the WHO
R&D Blueprint expert group.18 Ordinal scales have
been used as end points in clinical trials in patients hospitalized with severe influenza.16-19 The
seven-category ordinal scale consisted of the following categories: 1, not hospitalized with resumption of normal activities; 2, not hospitalized,
but unable to resume normal activities; 3, hospitalized, not requiring supplemental oxygen; 4,
hospitalized, requiring supplemental oxygen; 5,
hospitalized, requiring nasal high-flow oxygen
therapy, noninvasive mechanical ventilation, or
both; 6, hospitalized, requiring ECMO, invasive
mechanical ventilation, or both; and 7, death.
Other clinical outcomes included clinical status as assessed with the seven-category ordinal
scale on days 7 and 14, mortality at day 28, the
duration of mechanical ventilation, the duration
of hospitalization in survivors, and the time (in
days) from treatment initiation to death. Virologic
measures included the proportions with viral
RNA detection over time and viral RNA titer areaunder-the-curve (AUC) measurements.
Safety outcomes included adverse events that
occurred during treatment, serious adverse events,
and premature discontinuation of treatment. Adverse events were classified according to the
National Cancer Institute Common Terminology
Criteria for Adverse Events, version 4.0.

Patients were assessed once daily by trained nurses
using diary cards that captured data on a sevencategory ordinal scale and on safety from day 0
to day 28, hospital discharge, or death. Safety was
monitored by the Good Clinical Practice office
from Jin Yin-tan Hospital. Other clinical data
were recorded using the WHO-ISARIC (World
Health Organization–International Severe Acute
Respiratory and Emerging Infections Consortium) case record form (https://isaric​.­tghn​.­org).16
Serial oropharyngeal swab samples were obtained on day 1 (before lopinavir–ritonavir was
administered) and on days 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28
until discharge or death had occurred and were
tested at Teddy Clinical Research Laboratory
(Tigermed–DiAn Joint Venture), using quantitative real-time RT-PCR (see the Supplementary Appendix). RNA was extracted from clinical samples
with the MagNA Pure 96 system, detected and
quantified by Cobas z480 qPCR (Roche), with the Statistical Analysis

there was very limited information about clinical
outcomes in hospitalized patients with Covid-19.
The original total sample size was set at 160,
since it would provide the trial with 80% power
to detect a difference, at a two-sided significance level of α = 0.05, of 8 days in the median
time to clinical improvement between the two
groups, assuming that the median time in the
standard-care group was 20 days and that 75%
of the patients would reach clinical improvement. The planned enrollment of 160 patients in
the trial occurred quickly, and the assessment at
that point was that the trial was underpowered;
thus, a decision was made to continue enrollment by investigators. Subsequently, when another agent (remdesivir) became available for
clinical trials, we decided to suspend enrollment
in this trial.
Primary efficacy analysis was on an intention-to-treat basis and included all the patients
who had undergone randomization. The time to
clinical improvement was assessed after all patients had reached day 28, with failure to reach
clinical improvement or death before day 28
considered as right-censored at day 28 (rightcensoring occurs when an event may have occurred after the last time a person was under
observation, but the specific timing of the event
is unknown). The time to clinical improvement
was portrayed by Kaplan–Meier plot and compared with a log-rank test. Hazard ratios with
95% confidence intervals were calculated by
means of the Cox proportional-hazards model.
Five patients who had been assigned to the lopinavir–ritonavir group did not receive any doses
(three of them died within 24 hours) but were
included in the intention-to-treat analysis, since
no reciprocal removals occurred in the standardcare group. A modified intention-to-treat analysis
that excluded three early deaths was also performed. Post hoc analyses include subgroup analysis for National Early Warning Score 2 (NEWS2)19
of 5 or below or greater than 5 and those who
underwent randomization up to 12 days or more
than 12 days after the onset of illness.
Because the statistical analysis plan did not
include a provision for correcting for multiplicity
in tests for secondary or other outcomes, results
are reported as point estimates and 95% confidence intervals. The widths of the confidence intervals have not been adjusted for multiplicity, so

the intervals should not be used to infer definitive
treatment effects for secondary outcomes. Safety
analyses were based on the patients’ actual treatment exposure. Statistical analyses were conducted with SAS software, version 9.4 (SAS Institute).

R e sult s
Patients

Of the 199 patients who underwent randomization, 99 patients were assigned to receive lopinavir–ritonavir and 100 patients to standard care
alone. Of the 99 patients assigned to receive lopinavir–ritonavir, 94 (94.9%) received treatment as
assigned (Fig. 1). In the lopinavir–ritonavir group,
5 patients did not receive any doses of lopinavir–
ritonavir: 3 because of early death within 24 hours
after randomization and 2 others because the attending physician refused to prescribe lopinavir–
ritonavir after randomization.
The median age of patients was 58 years (interquartile range [IQR], 49 to 68 years), and 60.3%
of the patients were men (Table 1). The median
interval time between symptom onset and randomization was 13 days (IQR, 11 to 16 days) (Table 2). There were no important between-group
differences in demographic characteristics, baseline laboratory test results, distribution of ordinal
scale scores, or NEWS2 scores at enrollment.
During the trial, systemic glucocorticoids were
administered in 33.0% of the patients in the
lopinavir–ritonavir group and in 35.7% of those
in the standard-care group.
Primary Outcome

Patients assigned to lopinavir–ritonavir did not
have a time to clinical improvement different from
that of patients assigned to standard care alone in
the intention-to-treat population (median, 16 day
vs. 16 days; hazard ratio for clinical improvement, 1.31; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.95 to
1.85; P = 0.09) (Fig. 2). In the modified intentionto-treat population, the median time to clinical
improvement was 15 days in the lopinavir–ritonavir group, as compared with 16 days in the
standard-care group (hazard ratio, 1.39; 95% CI,
1.00 to 1.91) (Table S1 and Fig. S1 in the Supplementary Appendix). In the intention-to-treat population, lopinavir–ritonavir treatment within 12
days after the onset of symptoms was not found
to be associated with shorter time to clinical

later treatment with lopinavir–ritonavir (hazard
ratio, 1.30; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.99) (Fig. S2A and
S2B). No significant differences were observed
when the time to clinical improvement was assessed by NEWS2 score at entry in the intention-to-treat population (Fig. S3A and S3B). In
addition, when the time to clinical deterioration (defined as a one-category increase on the
seven-category scale) was compared between the
two groups, no difference was observed (hazard

difference, −8.3 percentage points; 95% CI, −19.6

Patients in the lopinavir–ritonavir group had
a shorter stay in the intensive care unit (ICU)
than those in the standard-care group (median,

care group reported adverse events between randomization and day 28 (Table 4). Gastrointestinal
adverse events including nausea, vomiting, and
diarrhea were more common in lopinavir–ritonavir
group than in the standard-care group (Table 4).
The percentages of patients with laboratory abnormalities were similar in the two groups (Table 4). Serious adverse events occurred in 51 patients: 19 events in the lopinavir–ritonavir group
and 32 events in the standard-care group (Table 4). There were 4 serious gastrointestinal adverse events in the lopinavir–ritonavir group but
none in the standard-care group; all 4 events were
judged by the investigators to be related to the
trial medication. Respiratory failure, acute kidney
injury, and secondary infection were more common in patients receiving standard care. All deaths
during the observation period were judged by
the site investigators to be unrelated to the intervention.

Discussion
This randomized trial found that lopinavir–ritonavir treatment added to standard supportive care
was not associated with clinical improvement or
mortality in seriously ill patients with Covid-19
different from that associated with standard
care alone. However, in the modified intentionto-treat analysis, which excluded three patients
with early death, the between-group difference in
8

of

m e dic i n e

the median time to clinical improvement (median,
15 days vs. 16 days) was significant, albeit modest. Of note, the overall mortality in this trial
(22.1%) was substantially higher than the 11% to
14.5% mortality reported in initial descriptive
studies of hospitalized patients with Covid-19,1,2
which indicates that we enrolled a severely ill
population.
Our patient population was heterogeneous with
regard to duration and severity of illness at enrollment. In a post hoc subgroup analysis, the
difference in mortality between the lopinavir–
ritonavir group and the standard-care group was
observed to be numerically greater among patients treated within 12 days after the onset of
symptoms than among those treated later. The
question of whether earlier lopinavir–ritonavir
treatment in Covid-19 could have clinical benefit
is an important one that requires further study.
The finding is consistent with studies showing
that patients with SARS-CoV-2 viral pneumonia
have progression in the second week of illness1
and with the time-to-treatment effects observed
in previous antiviral studies in SARS20 and severe
influenza.21-23 In addition, we found that the numbers of lopinavir–ritonavir recipients who had serious complications (acute kidney injury and secondary infections) or requiring noninvasive or
invasive mechanical ventilation for respiratory
failure were fewer than in those not receiving
treatment. These observations are hypothesisgenerating and require additional studies to determine whether lopinavir–ritonavir treatment
given at a certain stage of illness can reduce some
complications in Covid-19.
We did not find that adding lopinavir–ritonavir treatment reduced viral RNA loads or duration
of viral RNA detectability as compared with standard supportive care alone. SARS-CoV-2 RNA was
still detected in 40.7% of the patients in the
lopinavir–ritonavir group at end of the trial (day
28). A recent report showed that the median
duration of viral shedding in Covid-19 was 20
days in patients with severe illness and could be
as long as 37 days.24 Neither that study nor the
current one found evidence that lopinavir–ritonavir exerted a significant antiviral effect. The
reasons for the apparent lack of antiviral effect
are uncertain, but the sampling methods used in
the current trial were most likely suboptimal.
Samples were taken only intermittently (on days
1, 5, 10, 14, 21, and 28), and more frequent sam-

I bars indicate 95% confidence intervals. Results less than the lower limit of
quantification of polymerase-chain-reaction (PCR) assay and greater than
the limit of qualitative detection are imputed with 1 log10 copies per milliliter; results for patients with viral-negative RNA are imputed with 0 log10
copies per milliliter. Among the 199 patients, 130 (59 patients in the lopinavir–ritonavir group and 71 in the standard-care group) had virologic data
that were used for viral load calculation, whereas the rest of the patients
had undetectable viral RNA on throat swabs over the time.

pling in the first 5 days could have provided
more detailed characterization of viral load kinetics in the two groups over this critical period.
In addition, previous studies have shown that
throat-swab specimens have lower viral loads
than nasopharyngeal samples,25 and importantly, we were unable to do sampling of lower respiratory tract secretions. Of note, depending on
cell type used, the 50% effective concentrations
(EC50) of lopinavir in vitro for SARS-CoV has
ranged from 4.0 to 10.7 μg per milliliter,5,6,8 although other studies reported that lopinavir was
inactive26 or that higher concentrations (25 μg
per milliliter) were required for inhibition.7 For
MERS-CoV, the EC50 values have ranged from 5 to
approximately 7 μg per milliliter).1,8,13 Both the
mean peak (9.6 μg per milliliter) and trough
(5.5 μg per milliliter) serum concentrations of
lopinavir in adults just approach these concentrations. Whether the EC50 value is an adequate
threshold and whether unbound lopinavir concentrations in human plasma are sufficient for
inhibition of SARS-CoV-2 are questionable.1
Nearly 14% of lopinavir–ritonavir recipients

of

m e dic i n e

were unable to complete the full 14-day course of
administration. This was due primarily to gastrointestinal adverse events, including anorexia,
nausea, abdominal discomfort, or diarrhea, as well
as two serious adverse events, both acute gastritis.
Two recipients had self-limited skin eruptions.
Such side effects, including the risks of hepatic
injury, pancreatitis, more severe cutaneous eruptions, and QT prolongation, and the potential
for multiple drug interactions due to CYP3A inhibition, are well documented with this drug combination. The side-effect profile observed in the
current trial arouses concern about the use of
higher or more prolonged lopinavir–ritonavir
dose regimens in efforts to improve outcomes.
Our trial has several limitations. In particular, the trial was not blinded, so it is possible
that knowledge of the treatment assignment
might have influenced clinical decision-making
that could have affected the ordinal scale measurements we used. We will continue to follow
these patients to evaluate their long-term prognosis. The characteristics of the patients at baseline were generally balanced across the two groups,
but the somewhat higher throat viral loads in the
lopinavir–ritonavir group raise the possibility
that this group had more viral replication. Although we did not observe differences between
groups in the frequency of use of concurrent pharmacologic interventions, such as glucocorticoids,
this might have been another confounder. In addition, approximately 45% and 40% of the patients in lopinavir–ritonavir group had positive
RNA detection by throat swabs on day 14 and day
28, respectively, but we do not know if infectious
virus was still present, since we did not attempt
virus isolation or assess the possible emergence
of SARS-CoV-2 variants with reduced susceptibility to lopinavir. Finally, we do not have data
on the lopinavir exposure levels in these seriously and often critically ill patients.
In conclusion, we found that lopinavir–ritonavir treatment did not significantly accelerate
clinical improvement, reduce mortality, or diminish throat viral RNA detectability in patients with
serious Covid-19. These early data should inform
future studies to assess this and other medication
in the treatment of infection with SARS-CoV-2.
Whether combining lopinavir–ritonavir with other antiviral agents, as has been done in SARS5,20
and is being studied in MERS-CoV,15 might en-
