BACKGROUND

The initial cases of novel coronavirus (2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP)
occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China, in December 2019 and January 2020.
We analyzed data on the first 425 confirmed cases in Wuhan to determine the
epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP.
METHODS

We collected information on demographic characteristics, exposure history, and
illness timelines of laboratory-confirmed cases of NCIP that had been reported by
January 22, 2020. We described characteristics of the cases and estimated the key
epidemiologic time-delay distributions. In the early period of exponential growth,
we estimated the epidemic doubling time and the basic reproductive number.
RESULTS

Among the first 425 patients with confirmed NCIP, the median age was 59 years
and 56% were male. The majority of cases (55%) with onset before January 1, 2020,
were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, as compared with 8.6% of
the subsequent cases. The mean incubation period was 5.2 days (95% confidence
interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0), with the 95th percentile of the distribution at 12.5 days.
In its early stages, the epidemic doubled in size every 7.4 days. With a mean
serial interval of 7.5 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19), the basic reproductive number was
estimated to be 2.2 (95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).

CONCLUSIONS

On the basis of this information, there is evidence that human-to-human transmission has occurred among close contacts since the middle of December 2019.
Considerable efforts to reduce transmission will be required to control outbreaks
if similar dynamics apply elsewhere. Measures to prevent or reduce transmission
should be implemented in populations at risk. (Funded by the Ministry of Science

S

ince December 2019, an increasing
number of cases of novel coronavirus
(2019-nCoV)–infected pneumonia (NCIP)
have been identified in Wuhan, a large city of 11
million people in central China.1-3 On December
29, 2019, the first 4 cases reported, all linked to
the Huanan (Southern China) Seafood Wholesale Market, were identified by local hospitals
using a surveillance mechanism for “pneumonia
of unknown etiology” that was established in
the wake of the 2003 severe acute respiratory
syndrome (SARS) outbreak with the aim of allowing timely identification of novel pathogens
such as 2019-nCoV.4 In recent days, infections
have been identified in other Chinese cities and
in more than a dozen countries around the
world.5 Here, we provide an analysis of data on
the first 425 laboratory-confirmed cases in Wuhan to describe the epidemiologic characteristics
and transmission dynamics of NCIP.

Me thods
Sources of Data

The earliest cases were identified through the
“pneumonia of unknown etiology” surveillance
mechanism.4 Pneumonia of unknown etiology is
defined as an illness without a causative pathogen identified that fulfills the following criteria:
fever (≥38°C), radiographic evidence of pneumonia, low or normal white-cell count or low lymphocyte count, and no symptomatic improvement
after antimicrobial treatment for 3 to 5 days
following standard clinical guidelines. In response to the identification of pneumonia cases
and in an effort to increase the sensitivity for
early detection, we developed a tailored surveillance protocol to identify potential cases on
January 3, 2020, using the case definitions described below.1 Once a suspected case was identified, the joint field epidemiology team comprising members from the Chinese Center for
Disease Control and Prevention (China CDC)
together with provincial, local municipal CDCs
and prefecture CDCs would be informed to initiate detailed field investigations and collect respiratory specimens for centralized testing at the
National Institute for Viral Disease Control and
Prevention, China CDC, in Beijing. A joint team
comprising staff from China CDC and local
CDCs conducted detailed field investigations for
all suspected and confirmed 2019-nCoV cases.

Data were collected onto standardized forms
through interviews of infected persons, relatives,
close contacts, and health care workers. We collected information on the dates of illness onset,
visits to clinical facilities, hospitalization, and
clinical outcomes. Epidemiologic data were collected through interviews and field reports. Investigators interviewed each patient with infection and their relatives, where necessary, to
determine exposure histories during the 2 weeks
before the illness onset, including the dates,
times, frequency, and patterns of exposures to
any wild animals, especially those purportedly
available in the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market in Wuhan, or exposures to any relevant environments such as that specific market or other
wet markets. Information about contact with
others with similar symptoms was also included.
All epidemiologic information collected during
field investigations, including exposure history,
timelines of events, and close contact identification, was cross-checked with information from
multiple sources. Households and places known to
have been visited by the patients in the 2 weeks
before the onset of illness were also investigated
to assess for possible animal and environmental
exposures. Data were entered into a central database, in duplicate, and were verified with EpiData
software (EpiData Association).
Case Definitions

The initial working case definitions for suspected
NCIP were based on the SARS and Middle East
respiratory syndrome (MERS) case definitions,
as recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO) in 2003 and 2012.6-8 A suspected
NCIP case was defined as a pneumonia that either fulfilled all the following four criteria —
fever, with or without recorded temperature; radiographic evidence of pneumonia; low or normal
white-cell count or low lymphocyte count; and
no reduction in symptoms after antimicrobial
treatment for 3 days, following standard clinical
guidelines — or fulfilled the abovementioned
first three criteria and had an epidemiologic link
to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market or
contact with other patients with similar symptoms. The epidemiologic criteria to define a suspected case were updated on January 18, 2020,
once new information on identified cases became available. The criteria were the following:
a travel history to Wuhan or direct contact with

patients from Wuhan who had fever or respiratory symptoms, within 14 days before illness
onset.9 A confirmed case was defined as a case
with respiratory specimens that tested positive
for the 2019-nCoV by at least one of the following three methods: isolation of 2019-nCoV or at
least two positive results by real-time reversetranscription–polymerase-chain-reaction (RT-PCR)
assay for 2019-nCoV or a genetic sequence that
matches 2019-nCoV.

able. Onset-to-first-medical-visit and onset-toadmission distributions were estimated by fitting a Weibull distribution on the dates of
illness onset, first medical visit, and hospital
admission in a subset of cases with detailed information available. We fitted a gamma distribution to data from cluster investigations to estimate the serial interval distribution, defined as
the delay between illness onset dates in successive cases in chains of transmission.
We estimated the epidemic growth rate by
analyzing data on the cases with illness onset
between December 10 and January 4, because we
expected the proportion of infections identified
would increase soon after the formal announcement of the outbreak in Wuhan on December 31.
We fitted a transmission model (formulated with
the use of renewal equations) with zoonotic infections to onset dates that were not linked to
the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market, and we
used this model to derive the epidemic growth
rate, the epidemic doubling time, and the basic
reproductive number (R0), which is defined as
the expected number of additional cases that
one case will generate, on average, over the
course of its infectious period in an otherwise
uninfected population. We used an informative
prior distribution for the serial interval based on
the serial interval of SARS with a mean of 8.4
and a standard deviation of 3.8.11
Analyses of the incubation period, serial interval, growth rate, and R0 were performed with
the use of MATLAB software (MathWorks). Other
analyses were performed with the use of SAS
software (SAS Institute) and R software (R Foundation for Statistical Computing).

The 2019-nCoV laboratory test assays were based
on the previous WHO recommendation.10 Upper
and lower respiratory tract specimens were obtained from patients. RNA was extracted and
tested by real-time RT-PCR with 2019-nCoV–specific primers and probes. Tests were carried out
in biosafety level 2 facilities at the Hubei (provincial) CDC and then at the National Institute
for Viral Disease Control at China CDC. If two
targets (open reading frame 1a or 1b, nucleocapsid protein) tested positive by specific real-time
RT-PCR, the case would be considered to be
laboratory-confirmed. A cycle threshold value
(Ct-value) less than 37 was defined as a positive
test, and a Ct-value of 40 or more was defined
as a negative test. A medium load, defined as a
Ct-value of 37 to less than 40, required confirmation by retesting. If the repeated Ct-value was
less than 40 and an obvious peak was observed,
or if the repeated Ct-value was less than 37, the
retest was deemed positive. The genome was
identified in samples of bronchoalveolar-lavage
fluid from the patient by one of three methods:
Sanger sequencing, Illumina sequencing, or nanopore sequencing. Respiratory specimens were
inoculated in cells for viral isolation in enhanced Ethics Approval

a true turning point in incidence (Fig. 1). Specifically, the latter part of the curve does not
indicate a decrease in the number of incident
cases but is due to delayed case ascertainment at
the cutoff date. Care should be taken in interpreting the speed of growth in cases in January,
given an increase in the availability and use of
testing kits as time has progressed. The majority of the earliest cases included reported exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market,
but there was an exponential increase in the
number of nonlinked cases beginning in late
December.
The median age of the patients was 59 years
(range, 15 to 89), and 240 of the 425 patients
(56%) were male. There were no cases in children below 15 years of age. We examined char1202

acteristics of cases in three time periods: the
first period was for patients with illness onset
before January 1, which was the date the Huanan
Seafood Wholesale Market was closed; the second period was for those with onset between
January 1 and January 11, which was the date
when RT-PCR reagents were provided to Wuhan;
and the third period was those with illness onset
on or after January 12 (Table 1). The patients
with earlier onset were slightly younger, more
likely to be male, and much more likely to report
exposure to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale
Market. The proportion of cases in health care
workers gradually increased across the three
periods (Table 1).

incubation period to be 5.2 days (95% confidence interval [CI], 4.1 to 7.0); the 95th percentile of the distribution was 12.5 days (95% CI,
9.2 to 18) (Fig. 2A). We obtained information on
5 clusters of cases, shown in Figure 3. On the
basis of the dates of illness onset of 6 pairs of
cases in these clusters, we estimated that the
serial interval distribution had a mean (±SD) of
7.5±3.4 days (95% CI, 5.3 to 19) (Fig. 2B).
In the epidemic curve up to January 4, 2020, the
epidemic growth rate was 0.10 per day (95% CI,
0.050 to 0.16) and the doubling time was 7.4 days
(95% CI, 4.2 to 14). Using the serial interval
distribution above, we estimated that R0 was 2.2
(95% CI, 1.4 to 3.9).
The duration from illness onset to first
medical visit for 45 patients with illness onset
before January 1 was estimated to have a mean
of 5.8 days (95% CI, 4.3 to 7.5), which was
similar to that for 207 patients with illness onset
between January 1 and January 11, with a mean
of 4.6 days (95% CI, 4.1 to 5.1) (Fig. 2C). The
mean duration from onset to hospital admission
was estimated to be 12.5 days (95% CI, 10.3 to
14.8) among 44 cases with illness onset before
January 1, which was longer than that among
189 patients with illness onset between January 1

and 11 (mean, 9.1 days; 95% CI, 8.6 to 9.7) (Fig.
2D). We did not plot these distributions for patients with onset on or after January 12, because
those with recent onset and longer durations to
presentation would not yet have been detected.

Discussion
Here we provide an initial assessment of the
transmission dynamics and epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP. Although the majority of the
earliest cases were linked to the Huanan Seafood Wholesale Market and the patients could
have been infected through zoonotic or environmental exposures, it is now clear that human-tohuman transmission has been occurring and
that the epidemic has been gradually growing in
recent weeks. Our findings provide important
parameters for further analyses, including evaluations of the impact of control measures and
predictions of the future spread of infection.
We estimated an R0 of approximately 2.2,
meaning that on average each patient has been
spreading infection to 2.2 other people. In general, an epidemic will increase as long as R0 is
greater than 1, and control measures aim to reduce the reproductive number to less than 1. The

R0 of SARS was estimated to be around 3,12 and
SARS outbreaks were successfully controlled by
isolation of patients and careful infection control.13 In the case of NCIP, challenges to control
include the apparent presence of many mild infections14 and limited resources for isolation of
cases and quarantine of their close contacts. Our
estimate of R0 was limited to the period up to
January 4 because increases in awareness of the
outbreak and greater availability and use of tests
in more recent weeks will have increased the
proportions of infections ascertained. It is possible that subsequent control measures in Wuhan,
and more recently elsewhere in the country as
well as overseas, have reduced transmissibility,
but the detection of an increasing number of
cases in other domestic locations and around
the world suggest that the epidemic has contin1204

ued to increase in size. Although the population
quarantine of Wuhan and neighboring cities
since January 23 should reduce the exportation
of cases to the rest of the country and overseas,
it is now a priority to determine whether local
transmission at a similar intensity is occurring
in other locations.
It is notable that few of the early cases occurred in children, and almost half the 425 cases
were in adults 60 years of age or older, although
our case definition specified severe enough illness to require medical attention, which may
vary according to the presence of coexisting
conditions. Furthermore, children might be less
likely to become infected or, if infected, may
show milder symptoms, and either of these situations would account for underrepresentation in
the confirmed case count. Serosurveys after the

Numbers in boxes are calendar dates in December 2019 and January 2020. Data from the 5 secondary cases (patients who had clear exposure to only one index case and had no other potential source of infection) were used to estimate the serial interval distribution. The
first four clusters were identified in Wuhan, and the fifth cluster was identified in Huanggang.

first wave of the epidemic would clarify this question. Although infections in health care workers
have been detected, the proportion has not been
as high as during the SARS and MERS outbreaks.15 One of the features of SARS and MERS
outbreaks is heterogeneity in transmissibility,
and in particular the occurrence of super-spreading events, particularly in hospitals.16 Superspreading events have not yet been identified for
NCIP, but they could become a feature as the
epidemic progresses.
Although delays between the onset of illness
and seeking medical attention were generally
short, with 27% of patients seeking attention
within 2 days after onset, delays to hospitalization were much longer, with 89% of patients not
being hospitalized until at least day 5 of illness

(Fig. 2). This indicates the difficulty in identifying and isolating cases at an earlier stage of
disease. It may be necessary to commit considerable resources to testing in outpatient clinics
and emergency departments for proactive case
finding, both as part of the containment strategy
in locations without local spread yet as well as
to permit earlier clinical management of cases.
Such an approach would also provide important
information on the subclinical infections for a
better assessment of severity.
Our preliminary estimate of the incubation
period distribution provides important evidence
to support a 14-day medical observation period
or quarantine for exposed persons. Our estimate
was based on information from 10 cases and is
somewhat imprecise; it would be important for

further studies to provide more information on
this distribution. When more data become available on epidemiologic characteristics of NCIP, a
detailed comparison with the corresponding
characteristics of SARS and MERS, as well as the
four coronaviruses endemic in humans, would
be informative.
Our study suffers from the usual limitations
of initial investigations of infections with an
emerging novel pathogen, particularly during the
earliest phase, when little is known about any
aspect of the outbreak and there is a lack of diagnostic reagents. To increase the sensitivity for
early detection and diagnosis, epidemiology history was considered in the case identification
and has been continually modified once more
information has become available. Confirmed
cases could more easily be identified after the
PCR diagnostic reagents were made available to
Wuhan on January 11, which helped us shorten
the time for case confirmation. Furthermore, the
initial focus of case detection was on patients
with pneumonia, but we now understand that
some patients can present with gastrointestinal
symptoms, and an asymptomatic infection in a
child has also been reported.17 Early infections
with atypical presentations may have been missed,
and it is likely that infections of mild clinical
severity have been under-ascertained among the
confirmed cases.18 We did not have detailed information on disease severity for inclusion in this
analysis.
In conclusion, we found that cases of NCIP
have been doubling in size approximately every
7.4 days in Wuhan at this stage. Human-to-human
transmission among close contacts has occurred
since the middle of December and spread out
gradually within a month after that. Urgent next

of

steps include identifying the most effective control measures to reduce transmission in the community. The working case definitions may need
to be refined as more is learned about the epidemiologic characteristics and outbreak dynamics.
The characteristics of cases should continue to
be monitored to identify any changes in epidemiology — for example, increases in infections
among persons in younger age groups or health
care workers. Future studies could include forecasts of the epidemic dynamics and special studies of person-to-person transmission in households or other locations, and serosurveys to
determine the incidence of the subclinical infections would be valuable.14 These initial inferences
have been made on a “line list” that includes
detailed individual information on each confirmed case, but there may soon be too many
cases to sustain this approach to surveillance,
and other approaches may be required.19
