Abstract

15

Currently, the expansion of the novel human respiratory coronavirus (known as: SARS-CoV-2,

16

COVID-2019, or 2019-nCoV) has stressed the need for therapeutic alternatives to alleviate and

17

stop this new epidemic. The previous epidemics of high-morbidity human coronaviruses, such

18

as the acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in 2003, and the Middle East

19

respiratory syndrome corona virus (MERS-CoV) in 2012, prompted the characterization of

20

compounds that could be potentially active against the currently emerging novel coronavirus

21

SARS-CoV-2. The most promising compound is remdesivir (GS-5734), a nucleotide analog

22

prodrug currently in clinical trials for treating Ebola virus infections. Remdesivir inhibited the

23

replication of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV in tissue cultures, and it displayed efficacy in non-

24

human animal models. In addition, a combination of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1

25

(HIV-1) protease inhibitors, lopinavir/ritonavir, and interferon beta (LPV/RTV-INFb) were shown

26

to be effective in patients infected with SARS-CoV. LPV/RTV-INFb also improved clinical

27

parameters in marmosets and mice infected with MERS-CoV. Remarkably, the therapeutic

28

efficacy of remdesivir appeared to be superior to that of LPV/RTV-INFb against MERS-CoV in a

29

transgenic humanized mice model. The relatively high mortality rates associated with these

30

three novel human coronavirus infections, SARS-CoV, MERS-CoV, and SARS-CoV-2, has

31

suggested that pro-inflammatory responses might play a role in the pathogenesis. It remains

32

unknown whether the generated inflammatory state should be targeted. Therapeutics that

33

target the coronavirus alone might not be able to reverse highly pathogenic infections. This

34

minireview aimed to provide a summary of therapeutic compounds that showed potential in

35

fighting SARS-CoV-2 infections.

On December 30, 2019, a cluster of 27 pneumonia cases (including 7 severe cases) of unknown

37

origin emerged in Wuhan (Hubei, China) and were reported to the National Health Commission

38

of China (1). In the early stages of this pneumonia, patients developed severe acute respiratory

39

infection symptoms, and some patients rapidly developed acute respiratory distress syndrome

40

(2). Real time RT-PCR and deep sequencing analysis from lower respiratory tract samples

41

identified a novel human coronavirus, now called SARS-CoV-2 (3–5). By the end of January,

42

2020, nearly 50,000 confirmed cases were reported in China, and the first confirmed cases were

43

reported in Thailand, Nepal, Republic of Korea, USA, Singapore, France, Viet Nam, Canada,

44

Australia, Malaysia, Germany, UAE, Finland, Italy, Cambodia, Sri Lanka, the Russian Federation,

45

Spain, Sweden, India, and the Philippines. Among the patients with confirmed cases, most were

46

aged 30–80 years and had mild infections (80%). The fatality rate was around 2% (6).

47
48

Coronaviruses can cause different types of infections in diverse animals. In humans, they mainly

49

produce respiratory tract infections, as observed with SARS-CoV and MERS-Cov (7, 8).

50

Sequencing and phylogenetic analyses have shown that the novel SARSCoV-2 virus is closely

51

related to a group of human SARS-like coronaviruses and bat SARS-related coronaviruses (9–

52

11). The origin of SARSCoV-2 remains unclear; it is unknown how it was first transmitted to

53

humans. The high prevalence of SARS-related coronaviruses in bats has suggested that a bat

54

coronavirus might have jumped into a civet or some other mammal, and from there to humans,

55

which started the former 2003 SARS epidemic. Initial confirmed cases of SARSCoV-2 were

56

associated with Huanan seafood and live animal markets. However, no animal source has been

57

identified to date, and spillover events may continue to occur. Although bats might be the

3

36

58

source of SARSCoV-2, it is critical to identify the intermediate species to stop the current spread

59

and to prevent future human SARS-related coronavirus epidemics.

60

A key question is whether the current SARSCoV-2 epidemic is similar to other SARS outbreaks or

62

whether it shows different features. The epidemiological and clinical characteristics of

63

SARSCoV-2 indicate that this new outbreak is different from the 2003-SARS. SARSCoV-2 displays

64

higher transmissibility and lower mortality compared to the 2003-SARS (1, 3, 4). SARSCoV-2 has

65

shown efficient intra-familial spread (4). The asymptomatic period of SARSCoV-2 infections

66

oscillates between 2 and 14 days, and some individuals probably transmit the virus without

67

developing any disease symptoms. It remains to be elucidated whether this virus replicates

68

more readily in the upper airway than SARS-CoV and MEERS-CoV and whether it is similar to

69

other human coronaviruses (HCoV) that cause colds, but not pneumonia. It will be necessary to

70

identify molecular determinants that mediate transmission from animal to human, and from

71

human to human. Of note, in the novel SARS-CoV-2, the nucleotide sequence of the external

72

ectodomain in the spike protein receptor-binding domain is different from that of the 2003

73

SARS-CoV. When individual bat coronavirus spike genes were introduced into SARS-CoV

74

infectious clones, the SARS-CoV/bat-CoV spike viruses could bind to the human, bat, or civet

75

angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) cellular receptor (12). Understanding the interaction

76

between this novel SARS-CoV-2 spike protein and the host ACE2 receptor might reveal how this

77

virus overcame the species barrier between animals and humans. As discussed below, this

78

information might promote the design of effective antivirals.

61

To predict new zoonotic coronavirus jumps across species and to understand the rate of virus

81

spread among people, it is crucial to determine whether SARSCoV-2 is mutating to improve its

82

binding to human receptors for infection. As an RNA virus, SARS-CoV-2 has intrinsic genetic

83

variability, which results in a high mutation rate. Moreover, coronaviruses have the largest

84

genomes (∼30 kb) among RNA viruses. However, part of their sequence encodes a

85

proofreading 3' exonuclease that can increase replication fidelity (13). It has been suggested

86

that any adaptation in the SARS-CoV-2 sequence that might make it more efficient at

87

transmitting from person to person might also increase its virulence (14). However, this

88

mechanism could lead to a genetic bottleneck, known as Muller’s ratchet, which could

89

significantly decrease viral fitness, (15). Muller's ratchet predicts that, when mutation rates are

90

high and a significant proportion of mutations are deleterious, a type of irreversible ratchet

91

mechanism will gradually reduce the mean fitness of small populations of asexual organisms.

92

Because genetic bottlenecks for RNA viruses often occur during respiratory droplet

93

transmissions, the SARS-CoV-2 is expected to become less virulent through human to human

94

transmissions (16).

95
96

From the public health perspective, we urgently need to develop an effective vaccine and

97

antiviral therapeutics to stop the SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Moreover, social and economic issues

98

generated by this epidemic also call for rapid interventions. This review focuses on the

99

potential of repurposing preexisting compounds that might provide new opportunities for

100

treating people infected with SARS-CoV-2. Previous work with SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV has

101

provided an opportunity to accelerate the identification of meaningful therapies for fighting the

5

80

102

novel SARS-CoV-2 epidemic. Nevertheless, we must be aware that, currently, no compound

103

that targets SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV has moved beyond phase 1 trials.

104

The most promising antiviral for fighting SARS-CoV-2 is remdesivir (GS-5734). Remdesivir is an

106

adenosine nucleotide analogue prodrug with broad-spectrum antiviral activity against

107

filoviruses, paramyxoviruses, pneumoviruses, and pathogenic coronaviruses, like SARS-CoV and

108

MERS-CoV (17). Pharmacokinetic studies have been completed and clinical trials are ongoing

109

for testing remdesivir efficacy in treating Ebola virus (18). Previous studies have indicated that

110

nucleotide analogues generally show low efficacy against coronaviruses, due to the virus

111

exonuclease proofreading enzyme. Nevertheless, remdesivir was effective against SARS-CoV,

112

MERS-CoV, and bat-CoV strains (17). In tissue cultures, remdesivir displayed half-maximum

113

effective concentrations (EC50s) of 0.069 for SARS-CoV and 0.074 μM for MERS-CoV. Of note,

114

tissue culture studies have shown that remdesivir is also active in the submicromolar EC50

115

range against a number of highly divergent coronaviruses, including the endemic human CoVs,

116

OC43 (HCoV-OC43) and 229E (HCoV-229E). Thus, remdesivir has broad-spectrum anti-CoV

117

activity (19). In a mouse model of SARS-CoV pathogenesis, prophylactic and early therapeutic

118

administration of remdesivir significantly reduced the lung viral load. Viral titers were reduced

119

by >2 orders of magnitude on day 4 or 5 post infection. Remdesivir improved the clinical signs

120

of disease and respiratory function compared to untreated control animals (17). Comparable

121

results were obtained with MERS-CoV in prophylactic studies carried out with a MERS-CoV

122

mouse transgenic model. In that model, a humanized MERS-CoV receptor (dipeptidyl peptidase

123

4, hDPP4) was expressed and carboxylesterase 1c (Ces1c) was deleted to improve the

6

Downloaded from http://aac.asm.org/ on March 28, 2020 by guest

105

pharmacokinetics of nucleotide prodrugs (20). Remdesivir specificity for coronavirus was

125

demonstrated by propagating the virus in tissue culture. After 23 passages in the presence of

126

drug, two mutations were identified (F276L and V553L) in the viral RNA-dependent RNA

127

polymerase gene. These mutations increased the replication capacity of the virus in the

128

presence of remdesivir (21). However, these amino acid changes decreased the viral fitness and

129

attenuated SARS-CoV pathogenesis in mice (21). The efficacy of prophylactic and therapeutic

130

remdesivir treatment was recently tested in a nonhuman primate ( rhesus macaque) model of

131

MERS-CoV infection (22). When prophylactic remdesivir treatment was initiated 24 h prior to

132

inoculation, MERS-CoV was prevented from inducing clinical disease and inhibited from

133

replicating in respiratory tissues, which prevented the formation of lung lesions. Similar results

134

were obtained when therapeutic remdesivir treatment was initiated at 12 h after virus

135

inoculation (22). Human safety data are available for remdesivir (18); thus, human trials can be

136

initiated for testing the efficacy of this compound against novel coronaviruses.

137
138

Therapies that are approved by the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) have been evaluated

139

for antiviral activity against SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV. For example, lopinavir (LPV), a human

140

immunodeficiency virus 1 (HIV-1) protease inhibitor, was combined with ritonavir (RTV) to

141

increase the LPV half-life. LPV/RTV was shown to be effective against SARS-CoV in patients and

142

in tissue culture. The estimated EC50 in fetal rhesus kidney-4 cells was 4 µg/ml (23). LPV/RTV

143

also reduced weight loss, clinical scores, viral titers, and disease progression in marmosets

144

infected with MERS-CoV (24). Nevertheless, the antiviral activity of LPV against MERS-CoV in

7

Downloaded from http://aac.asm.org/ on March 28, 2020 by guest

124

145

tissue culture remains controversial. No optimal EC50 was found in Vero cells (25), but an EC50

146

of 8 µM was reported in Huh7 cells (26).

147

Clinical observations in animals and humans showed that MERS-CoV infections were mediated

149

by both virus replication and host inflammatory responses. Those findings led to explorations of

150

combination therapies that included types I and II interferons (IFN I and II). Interferon beta

151

(IFNb) displayed the best efficacy, with EC50s of 1.37-17 IU/ml, for reducing MERS-CoV

152

replication in tissue culture (25, 27). Similar to LPV/RTV, clinical improvements with IFNb were

153

observed in common marmosets infected with MERS-CoV (24). In the Kingdom of South Arabia,

154

an ongoing randomized control trial (MIRACLE Trial) was initiated to determine whether the

155

combination of LPV/RTV and IFNb could improve clinical outcomes in MERS-CoV infections (28).

156

Importantly, another controlled trial was launched in China to test the efficacy of LPV/RTV and

157

IFNα-2b in hospitalized patients with SARS-CoV-2 infections (ChiCTR2000029308).

158
159

The prophylactic and therapeutic properties of remdesivir and LPV/RTV-IFNb were compared in

160

a humanized transgenic mouse MERS-CoV infection model (29). Remdesivir improved

161

pulmonary function, reduced lung viral loads, and ameliorated severe lung pathology. In

162

contrast, prophylactic LPV/RTV-IFNb only slightly reduced viral loads and did not impact other

163

disease parameters, and therapeutic LPV/RTV-IFNb improved pulmonary function, but did not

164

reduce virus replication or severe lung pathology (29). Overall, these results indicated that

165

remdesivir showed more potential than LPV/RTV-IFNb for treating MERS-CoV infections.

Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, is an antiviral compound used to treat several virus infections,

168

including respiratory syncytial virus, hepatitis C virus, and some viral hemorrhagic fevers. In

169

most cases, ribavirin is combined with IFN. Ribavirin was first marketed in 1980 for the

170

treatment of respiratory syncytial virus in children. Although promising results were obtained

171

with ribavirin and IFNα-2b in a MERS-CoV rhesus macaque model (30), data have been

172

conflicting on patients with MERS-CoV infections that were treated with a combination of

173

ribavirin and IFN (either α2a or β1) (31). However, ribavirin reduces hemoglobin

174

concentrations, an undesirable side effect in patients with respiratory disorders. This feature

175

reduces its potential as an antiviral against SARS-CoV-2.

176
177

Work with influenza virus has shown that monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies can be useful

178

prophylactic and therapeutic tools. Several antibodies have been shown to bind influenza virus

179

hemagglutinin and inhibit virus replication (12). For example, human immunoglobulin G1 (IgG1)

180

monoclonal antibody (MHAA4549A) binds to a highly conserved epitope on the stalk of

181

influenza A hemagglutinin. In a phase 2 human influenza A virus challenge study, MHAA4549A

182

significantly reduced the clinical symptoms and viral burden relative to placebo (32). Another

183

example is VIS410, a monoclonal antibody engineered to target all known influenza A strains. A

184

phase 2a trial showed that VIS410 had some clinical benefits (33). Current development efforts

185

in monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies against coronaviruses are mainly targeting MERS-CoV.

186

In a phase 1 clinical trial, a human polyclonal antibody, SAB-301, which is generated in trans-

187

chromosomic cattle, was found to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants. (34).

188

However, therapeutic treatment with human monoclonal antibodies did not protect against the

9

Downloaded from http://aac.asm.org/ on March 28, 2020 by guest

167

severe disease or the loss of lung function induced by MERS-CoV in animal models (20). The

190

lack of viral sequence homology among different human coronaviruses suggests that current

191

investigational antibody-based therapeutics will not be effective against novel virus variants.

192

Nevertheless, immune-based therapies should be not discarded, when considering future

193

treatments for novel coronaviruses.

194
195

Another potential treatment option could be the use of novel coronavirus sera prepared from

196

the blood of patients in convalescence (convalescent sera). Passive immunization is well

197

established for viral infection prophylaxis. Polyclonal antibody products have been licensed that

198

target cytomegalovirus, hepatitis B virus, and varicella-zoster virus. A meta-analysis of reports

199

on the 1918 influenza A (H1N1) epidemic concluded that early administration of convalescent

200

blood products reduced the absolute risk of pneumonia-related death from 37% to 16% (35).

201

Nevertheless, the appropriate titer of convalescent sera antibody that is required for

202

therapeutic efficacy against SARS-CoV-2 remains to be determined. Moreover, additional

203

studies performed with influenza virus have produced controversial results regarding the

204

clinical benefit of administering high titers of anti-influenza immunoglobulins (36). Finally, it

205

remains unclear whether a sufficient pool of potential donors is feasible. Work carried out with

206

MERS-CoV showed that sera from patients recovering from infections did not contain sufficient

207

antibody titers for therapeutic use (37).

208
209

Another interesting therapeutic alternative that was previously explored with influenza virus is

210

to target cellular components involved in the host inflammatory response to the infection. For

10

Downloaded from http://aac.asm.org/ on March 28, 2020 by guest

189

example, the activation of the inflammatory response to an infection can induce a cytokine

212

outburst that results in an acute lung injury. An example of a therapy for this type of infection

213

has been to target the cellular toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) with specific antibodies. TLR4 is a

214

transmembrane protein that belongs to the pattern recognition receptor (PRR) family. The

215

prototype pathogen-associated molecular pattern (PAMP) that TLR4 recognizes is the gram-

216

negative bacteria, endotoxin, lipopolysaccharide (LPS). TLR4 has been implicated in the

217

pathology associated with other infections and with tissue damage caused by non-infectious

218

insults. TLR4 activation leads to the NF-κB intracellular signaling pathway and inflammatory

219

cytokine production, which activate the innate immune system. Interestingly, TLR4-null mice

220

were highly resistant to infection by the mouse-adapted influenza A virus (38). Thus, protection

221

against influenza infections was achieved by targeting TLR4 with small molecule antagonists,

222

like TAK-242, or with anti-TLR4-specific antibodies (39, 40). Indeed, targeting a cellular protein

223

would overcome the drawbacks associated with virus or coronavirus genetic heterogeneity.

224
225

The high mortally rates observed in some emerging respiratory diseases induced by viruses like

226

MERS-CoV, SARS-CoV, and novel influenza A strains (H5N1) has given rise to the hypothesis that

227

the pro-inflammatory response might be involved in the disease pathogenesis. Consequently,

228

immunosuppressants (e.g., corticosteroids) might be used as an adjunct for treating severe

229

forms of the disease. However, the therapeutic use of immunosuppressants is not free of

230

controversy. To date, no conclusive results have been found for the effects of

231

immunosuppressants in severe influenza virus infections (12). Furthermore, the use of

232

corticosteroids to treat influenza virus has been associated with an increased risk of

11

Downloaded from http://aac.asm.org/ on March 28, 2020 by guest

211

superinfection, prolonged viral replication, and an increased risk of death (41). In contrast,

234

corticosteroid treatment for MERS-CoV infections was not significantly associated with

235

mortality, although a delay in MERS-CoV RNA clearance was observed (42). Further studies

236

should be performed to clarify the potential clinical benefit of prescribing immunosuppressants

237

for coronavirus infections.

238
239

To end this minireview, we will discuss an interesting potential antiviral strategy. The spike

240

protein of SARS-CoV mediates viral entry into target cells. Intriguingly, the cleavage and

241

activation of the SARS-CoV spike protein by a host cell protease is essential for infectious viral

242

entry (43). This host protease could be a type II transmembrane serine protease, TMPRSS2,

243

which was shown to cleave and activate SARS-CoV spike protein in cell cultures. Therefore,

244

TMPRSS2 is a potential a target for antiviral interventions. For example, the serine protease

245

inhibitor, camostat mesylate, inhibits the enzymatic activity of TMPRSS2 (44). Recently, K11777,

246

a cysteine protease inhibitor, was shown in tissue cultures to inhibit SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV

247

replication in the sub-nanomolar range (45). Future tissue culture and animal model studies

248

should be conducted to clarify the potential antiviral activity of targeting TMPRSS2.

249
250

By the end of February 2020, two months after the first cases of SARS-CoV-2 were reported in

251

China, several hundreds of new infection cases had been registered, mainly in other Asian

252

regions and Europe. This news has strongly suggested that we are in the thick of a SARS-CoV-2

253

pandemic. Social alarm and health authorities have called for the development of therapeutic

254

alternatives for fighting the current, and possibly new, coronavirus epidemics. Animal models

233

255

and clinical studies are urgently needed for evaluating the effectiveness and safety of promising

256

antiviral compounds that target the virus and/or the immunopathology involved in the host

257

responses. The identification and characterization of novel compounds and therapeutic

258

alternatives will be required to better control this probable pandemic outbreak.
