Summary

Background Since the coronavirus disease 2019 outbreak began in the Chinese city of Wuhan on Dec 31, 2019, 68 imported
cases and 175 locally acquired infections have been reported in Singapore. We aimed to investigate options for early
intervention in Singapore should local containment (eg, preventing disease spread through contact tracing efforts) be
unsuccessful.
Methods We adapted an influenza epidemic simulation model to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human
transmission of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2) in a simulated Singaporean
population. Using this model, we estimated the cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections at 80 days, after
detection of 100 cases of community transmission, under three infectivity scenarios (basic reproduction number [R0]
of 1∙5, 2∙0, or 2∙5) and assuming 7·5% of infections are asymptomatic. We first ran the model assuming no
intervention was in place (baseline scenario), and then assessed the effect of four intervention scenarios compared
with a baseline scenario on the size and progression of the outbreak for each R0 value. These scenarios included
isolation measures for infected individuals and quarantining of family members (hereafter referred to as quarantine);
quarantine plus school closure; quarantine plus workplace distancing; and quarantine, school closure, and workplace
distancing (hereafter referred to as the combined intervention). We also did sensitivity analyses by altering the
asymptomatic fraction of infections (22·7%, 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%) to compare outbreak sizes under the same
control measures.
Findings For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1·5, the median cumulative number of infections at day 80 was
279 000 (IQR 245 000–320 000), corresponding to 7∙4% (IQR 6·5–8·5) of the resident population of Singapore. The
median number of infections increased with higher infectivity: 727 000 cases (670 000–776 000) when R0 was 2·0,
corresponding to 19∙3% (17∙8–20∙6) of the Singaporean population, and 1 207 000 cases (1 164 000–1 249 000) when
R0 was 2·5, corresponding to 32% (30∙9–33∙1) of the Singaporean population. Compared with the baseline scenario,
the combined intervention was the most effective, reducing the estimated median number of infections by 99∙3%
(IQR 92∙6–99∙9) when R0 was 1·5, by 93·0% (81∙5–99∙7) when R0 was 2·0, and by 78∙2% (59·0 –94∙4) when R0 was
2·5. Assuming increasing asymptomatic fractions up to 50·0%, up to 277 000 infections were estimated to occur at
day 80 with the combined intervention relative to 1800 for the baseline at R0 of 1·5.

Interpretation Implementing the combined intervention of quarantining infected individuals and their family
members, workplace distancing, and school closure once community transmission has been detected could
substantially reduce the number of SARS-CoV-2 infections. We therefore recommend immediate deployment of this
strategy if local secondary transmission is confirmed within Singapore. However, quarantine and workplace
distancing should be prioritised over school closure because at this early stage, symptomatic children have higher
withdrawal rates from school than do symptomatic adults from work. At higher asymptomatic proportions,
intervention effectiveness might be substantially reduced requiring the need for effective case management and
treatments, and preventive measures such as vaccines.

Introduction
In December, 2019, several health facilities in the
Chinese city of Wuhan (Hubei province) reported
clusters of individuals with pneumonia1 whose clinical
presentations resembled the symptoms of severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which
emerged in 2002 in the nearby Guangdong province and
led to outbreaks worldwide.2 On Jan 7, 2020, a novel
strain of coronavirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome

corona­virus 2 (SARS-CoV-2), was isolated, confirming
the circulation of a new respiratory illness, coronavirus
disease 2019 (COVID-19), with evidence suggesting that
the Huanan seafood wholesale market was the initial
transmission site.3 On Jan 1, 2020, the market was closed
for environmental sanitation and disinfection to prevent
further transmission.4 Cases of COVID-19 have since
been reported in health-care workers3 and family clusters
in China,5 with 67 794 cases and 3805 deaths confirmed

Research in context
Evidence before this study
At present, in Wuhan, the capital of Hubei province in China,
an outbreak of coronavirus disease 2019 (COVID-19) is
ongoing, caused by the 2019 novel coronavirus, severe acute
respiratory syndrome coronavirus 2 (SARS-CoV-2; previously
called 2019-nCoV). Evidence to date has suggested rapid spread
of the virus: at the time of writing, imported cases have been
reported in 143 countries and territories, including Singapore.
243 confirmed cases have been reported in Singapore; however,
this number is expected to increase substantially in the
following weeks. In 2003, SARS-CoV, which also originated
from mainland China, established locally, causing 33 deaths
after 238 cases were confirmed. Therefore, there is considerable
concern since 3204 deaths and 81 048 cases of COVID-19 have
already been confirmed in mainland China, which surpasses the
numbers observed in the SARS-CoV outbreak. 2020 Lunar
New Year celebrations have now ended, marking a period
of extensive travel between China and Singapore, and a
corresponding high risk for case importation. Despite
heightened surveillance and isolation of individuals suspected
to have COVID-19 and confirmed cases, the risk is ongoing,
with the number of cases continuing to increase in Singapore.
Immediate deployment of interventions will be required to
contain the outbreak in the event that significant secondary
local transmission is observed within the community. We
searched PubMed from database inception to Feb 26, 2020,
for articles using the search terms “Wuhan coronavirus”,
“COVID-19”, “SARS-CoV-2”, “2019-nCoV”, and “coronavirus
interventions”. Our search yielded three relevant articles.

in Hubei province as of March 15, 2020.6 Older
individuals (aged >60 years) and people with chronic
underlying health conditions are particularly susceptible
to severe disease.5 Rapid spread of the virus compelled
the Chinese Government to restrict movement in
affected cities, with the cessation of public transport7 and
cancellation of flights.8 Despite extensive efforts to
prevent onward spread, 143 countries and territories
outside of mainland China have now reported imported
cases.6
Internationally, ongoing local transmission of
SARS-CoV-2 has been confirmed in 81 countries and
territories.6 In Singapore, 243 individuals have tested
positive for SARS-CoV-2, 121 have been hospitalised and
are stable, 13 are in a critical condition, and 109 have
been discharged at the time of writing.9 The first case in
Singapore was identified on Jan 23, 2020, and was
imported from China;10 a further 68 cases were imported,
with the remaining 175 cases most likely the result
of transmission within Singapore.11 All imported cases
were travellers who had returned from Wuhan before
Feb 4, 2020, with transmission to close contacts recorded
within families at a church and shop in three small
transmission clusters.11

Two articles investigated the effects of travel restrictions in
Wuhan during the early stages of the outbreak; one of the
articles additionally investigated the effects of quarantine in
China, and the other article estimated the effectiveness of
airport screening for the detection of infected travellers.
We found no articles assessing the efficacy of immediate
national control measures outside of China.
Added value of this study
This study is the first to investigate the use of isolation for
individuals with COVID-19 and quarantine of family members,
school closures, and workplace distancing as interventions for
the immediate control of COVID-19 in the event of secondary
local transmission using a simulation model. We found that a
combined approach (incorporating quarantine, school closures,
and workplace distancing) could prevent a national outbreak at
low levels of infectivity and reduce the number of total
infections considerably at higher levels of infectivity. Such
control measures should be deployed in countries outside of
China with evidence of imported cases and evidence of local
transmission.
Implications of all the available evidence
The results of this study provide policy makers in Singapore and
other countries with evidence to begin the implementation of
relatively standard outbreak control measures that could
mitigate or reduce local transmission rates if deployed
effectively and in a timely manner.

As of March 16, 2020, inpatients with COVID-19 in
Singapore are isolated at the hospital they present to or at
the National Centre for Infectious Diseases, a specialised
facility designed to facilitate infectious disease outbreak
response.10 A government-wide taskforce has been
established to increase surveillance at borders and
prepare the public in terms of awareness and education.10
The Ministry of Health Singapore has implemented
contact tracing efforts to identify potential cases among
people travelling with, or in close proximity to, individuals
with COVID-19.12 Despite these efforts and nationwide
precautionary measures, including the dispensing of
masks to households and public hospital emergency
departments being on high alert for an outbreak response,
the number of suspected and imported cases in Singapore
is expected to increase due to the high volume of
incoming travellers.10 Preliminary estimates indicate that
the ascertainment rate in Wuhan is 5∙1% (95% CI
4∙8–5∙5);13 however, high levels of under-reporting and
misdiagnosis due to difficulties in identifying cases make
it challenging for policy makers to prepare a large-scale
response. Consequently, following the recom­mendations
made by Wu and colleagues,14 modelling studies are
needed to estimate the potential impact of interventions

in the early phase of the outbreak when uncertainty is
highest, which is crucial should local transmission begin
to increase.
In this study, we aimed to develop a national spatial
model of COVID-19 transmission in Singapore to
estimate the distribution of cases across time and space
and to assess the potential impact of interventions on
outbreak size should local containment efforts fail.

Methods

Epidemic simulation model
We used FluTE,15 an agent-based influenza epidemic
simulation model, which accounts for demography, host
movement, and social contact rates in workplaces, schools,
and homes to estimate the likelihood of human-to-human
transmission of SARS-CoV-2 should local containment
fail. The FluTE simulation model requires a synthetic
population to build the contact and transmission network.
Therefore, we used the geographical, demographic, and
epidemiological model of Singapore (hereafter referred
to as GeoDEMOS-R, where R represents respiratory
illness),16 a modelling framework that aims to recreate a
synthetic but realistic representation of the Singaporean
population at the household and individual level. We
generated the synthetic population using national 2010
census data17,18 to fit multiple attributes of the population at
the household and individual level. The generated house­
holds contained demographic characteristics, such as age,
marital status, religion, and ethnicity, of household
members. Individuals were then allocated to workplaces
or educational facilities on the basis of local transportation
data and home addresses according to 2010 census
data.19 The contact behaviour of individuals in the area
of their home (ie, between family members and their local
community; defined as the home community), workplace,
and school, where applicable, were recorded with potential
transmission events as a function of infectivity. We ran the
models for 80 days to investigate the early stages of an
epidemic and seeded 100 local cases randomly among
the resident population at 0 days, representing a few
generations of local transmission at the time of scenario
implementation (ie, when contact tracing has failed to
identify cases within the community and unknown local
transmission has started). A full description of the model
is available in the appendix (pp 1–5).

SARS-CoV-2 infection parameters
Within the FluTE infection model, we assumed that no
individual had existing immunity to SARS-CoV-2. Since
data (ie, infectiousness, the cumulative distribution
function for the incubation period, and the duration
of hospital stay) on SARS-CoV-2 were unavailable at
the time of designing this study, we used SARS-CoV
parameters to estimate the infectivity profile of
SARS-CoV-2. These parameters included how infectious
an individual is over time,20 the proportion of the
population assumed to be asymptomatic (7·5%),21 the

cumulative distribution function for the mean incubation
period (with SARS-CoV and SARS-CoV-2 having the
same mean incubation period of 5·3 days),3,22 and the
duration of hospital stay after symptom onset (3·5 days).20
Asymptomatic individuals were able to infect at a
50% reduced rate compared with their symptomatic
counterparts based on estimates from Nishiura and
colleagues.23
We also investigated four alternate asymptomatic
proportions: 22·7%, as reported by Furuya-Kanamori
and colleagues24 for influenza A H1N1 in a pooled
prevalence study; and 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%, as
potential but theoretical proportions to investigate
intervention efficacy with a high fraction of infections
that are cryptic and undetectable.
Three values for the basic reproduction number (R0)
were chosen for the infectiousness factor (1∙5, 2·0, and
2∙5) on the basis of analyses of Wuhan case data by Wu
and colleagues.14

Intervention scenarios
For the baseline scenario (ie, no interventions), we ran
1000 epidemic simulations to account for the stochasticity
in infection contact networks and to calculate CIs
across time. Four intervention scenarios were proposed
for implementation after failure of local containment,
following policy options currently being assessed by the
Singaporean Ministry of Health, as standard interventions
for respiratory virus control: isolation of infected
individuals and quarantine of their family members
(hereafter referred to as quarantine); quarantine plus
immediate school closure for 2 weeks; quarantine plus
immediate workplace distancing, in which 50% of the
workforce is encouraged to work from home for 2 weeks;
and a combination of quarantine, immediate school
closure, and workplace distancing (hereafter referred to
as the combined intervention). Quarantine of infected
individuals is expected to occur 1 day after symptom onset
in a health-care facility that is assumed to have 3000 beds
at maximum capacity (during the early stage of the
outbreak) and is fully equipped to handle full quarantine
measures (ie, negative pressure isolation rooms, full
personal protective equipment use by staff) so that the
individual is unable to transmit SARS-CoV-2 to other
inpatients. At full capacity, the remaining individuals
are isolated at home after receiving treatment. Family
members of infected individuals are quarantined at home
for 14 days and thus are unable to attend work or school or
infect the wider community at their residential address.
However, transmission within families is possible as
a result of the presence of an isolated and infected
individual. Each of these intervention scenarios had
1000 simulations in which we additionally recorded the
location of infection as the home community, workplace,
or school (appendix pp 3–4).
Each of the 1000 epidemic simulations had a set of
parameters, and was run for baseline and the four

the same parameters, not the medians of each grouping.
We calculated IQRs as the 25th and 75th simulation in
terms of cumulative case count at 80 days. We used R
statistical software (version 3.6.3) to plot graphs and for
all analyses. We chose to present intervention data for
the scenario in which R0 is 2·0, because this represents a
moderate and likely outbreak for policy planners. The
relatively mild (R0 =1·5) and severe (R0 =2.5) outbreak
scenarios are presented in the appendix (pp 9–10).

For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 1·5, the median
cumulative number of infections on day 80 was 279 000
(IQR 245 000–320 000; figure 1, table), which corresponds
to 7∙4% (IQR 6∙5–8∙5) of the population. For the
quarantine intervention, the median cumulative number
of infections at day 80 was reduced to 15 000 (800–30 000;
table; appendix p 9), which is a 94∙8% decrease
(90·2–99·7) in the number of infected individuals
compared with the baseline scenario. School closure and
workplace distancing reduced the median cumulative
number of infections on day 80 to 10 000 (200–28 000) and
4000 (200–23 000), respectively (table; appendix p 9). The
combined inter­vention decreased the median cumulative
infection count on day 80 to 1800 (200–23 000; table;
appendix p 9), representing a 99∙3% (IQR 92·6–99·9)
reduction from the baseline scenario. The corresponding
maximum number of daily infections from day 0 to day 80
was 12 400 (IQR 11 700–12 900) for the baseline scenario,
600 (0–1400) for the quarantine scenario, 500 (0–1300) for
the school-closure scenario, 300 (0–900) for the workplacedistancing scenario, and 120 (0–900) for the combined
intervention (figure 1; appendix p 9).
When R0 was 2·0, the proportion of the Singaporean
population infected under the baseline scenario increa­sed to
19∙3% (IQR 17∙8–20∙6), with a median cumulative number
of infections on day 80 of 727 000 (IQR 670 000–776 000;
figure 1, table). On day 80, quarantine resulted in a cumu­
lative median of 130 
000 cases (38 
000–244 
000), school
closure 97 000 cases (14 000–219 000), workplace distancing
67 000 cases (11 000–145 000), and the combined intervention
50 000 cases (2000–143 000; figure 2, table). The maximum
number of daily infections was 27 800 (IQR 27 300–28 000)
for the baseline scenario, 11 
000 (4100–18 
600) for the
quarantine scenario, 8400 (1900–17 
000) for the schoolclosure scenario, 6100 (1500–12 
000) for the workplacedistancing scenario, and 4900 (100–11 700) for the combined
intervention (figures 1, 2). The combined approach
resulted in the largest reduction in cases from baseline
(93·0% reduction [IQR 81·5–99·7]).

in the summations. Due to the stochasticity within each simulation, numbers less than 20 indicate nearly complete suppression and should not be compared to assess effectiveness. SARS-CoV-2=severe acute

Table: Estimated median or cumulative number of SARS-CoV-2 infections on day 80 by location, intervention, and level of infectivity

For the baseline scenario, when R0 was 2·5, 32%
(IQR 30∙9–33∙1) of the Singaporean population were
infected, with a cumulative median of 1 207 000 cases
(IQR 1 164 000–1 249 000) on day 80 (figure 1, table). At
this level of trans­
mission, quarantine resulted in a
median of 520

workplace-distancing scenario, and 25 200 (7700–39 200)
for the combined intervention (figure 1; appendix
p 10). Com­pared with baseline, the combined approach
resulted in the greatest reduction in cases (78·2%
[IQR 59·0–94·4]).
For all simulations, the median age of infection was
37 years (IQR 26–49). The location of infection (school,
workplace, or home community) was determined
according to the site where individuals were exposed to
the virus (table). Owing to behaviours of school
absenteeism and work-distancing presenteeism, the
number of infections acquired at work consistently
exceeded those at school, although students could be
transmitting the virus within the home community
(table). Such patterns of transmission are particularly
evident for the combined intervention at higher levels of
infectivity (R0=2·5), with a median of 1300 infections
acquired at school (IQR 300–2800), 124 
000 at the
workplace (31 000–241 000), and 132 000 (34 000–265 000)
in the home community.

The median number of daily infections across time
showed that when R0 was 1·5 or 2·0, the epidemic peak
was unlikely to occur during the 80-day timeframe,
whereas when R0 was 2·5, a peak in cases was observed
approximately 9 weeks after reaching 100 community
infections (figure 1). When R0 was 2·5, the interventions
had a suppressive effect on the number of new cases each
day, although the number of cases continued to increase
at day 80, indicating a delayed intervention effect rather
than a preventive effect as observed when R0 was 1·5
(figure 2; appendix pp 9–10). Geospatially, the number of
cases across Singapore at day 80 show a high number of
home community infections in highly residential areas
and considerable infection-source mixing (figure 3;
appendix p 11). The combined intervention had the
greatest effect on the number of infections, with a
universal reduction across Singapore when R0 was
1·5 (figure 3). The combined intervention had a smaller
effect when R0 was 2·0 or 2·5, with a relatively
homogeneous distribution nationwide, although dense
residential clusters in the north of Singapore, in areas
near the Malaysia border, indicate strong comparative
persistence of the virus despite the use of the combined
approach (figure 3).
Our models assumed that 7·5% of cases were asymp­
tomatic. Considering a higher asymptomatic proportion
of the total infected population of 22·7%, owing to
isolation of fewer infected individuals and quarantine of
fewer family members, for the quarantine scenario when
R0 was 1·5, an additional 100 000 cases (IQR 41 800–152 000)
would be observed at 80 days (appendix p 7). Similarly, a
higher asymptomatic proportion resulted in a higher
median cumulative number of cases for the schoolclosure, work-distancing, and combined intervention

The median number of infections and location of infec­
tion for the higher theoretical asymptomatic proportions
are presented in the appendix (p 8). At higher asymp­
tomatic proportions of 30·0%, 40·0%, and 50·0%, further
increases were observed (appendix pp 8, 15–19). We only
ran the analysis at higher asymptomatic rates at the lower
level of infectivity (R0=1·5), because we observed
substantial increases in the number of cases observed,
reflecting poor case control that would otherwise be
exacerbated and lead to containment failure at higher
infectivity. When R0 was 1·5, interventions caused
substantial reductions in the number of infections at
asymptomatic fractions of 7·5% and 22·7%. For
quarantine, by comparison with the number of cases
observed for the 7·5% asymptomatic proportion
assumption when R0 was 1·5, the median number of
cases increased by 172 000 (IQR 113 000–221 000) for a

to 253 000 (209 000–294 000) for a 40·0% asymptomatic

Discussion
Concerns about COVID-19 becoming a global epidemic
are increasing on the basis of previous epidemics, such as
SARS-CoV, Middle East respiratory syndrome corona­
virus (MERS-CoV), and pandemic influenza. The intro­
duction of cases into new countries, regions and cities is

likely to continue in areas where local establishment
could form, depending on the ongoing level of control
measures. In the event that local containment is
unsuccessful, our findings suggest that national outbreak
control is feasible provided that R0 is low (≤1∙5), with a
combination of the proposed inter­
vention measures
(quarantine, school closure, and workplace distancing)
being most effective. Under this scenario (R0=1·5),
workplace distancing reduced the median number
of cases from 279 000 (IQR 245 000– 320 000) to 4000
(200–23 000), as a result of the high employment rates
(around 98%) among individuals of working age in
Singapore.25 This observation is consistent with the
conclusions of a review of 15 studies that found a median
reduction of 23% (range 12–82) in the cumulative
influenza A H1N1 attack rate with workplace distancing
alone.26 The implementation of such a control measure,
however, is likely to have an acute societal economic
effect on individuals who must work from home or take
leave, especially if reimbursement is not possible. Thus,
decision making becomes a function of risk as to whether
the imported cases have or will infect the local population
and cause a local outbreak. An R0 value of 1·5 is not
consistent with the evidence from China,14 and thus
prevention of community transmission might not be
possible using interventions that would be widely
supported by the population.
At the start of the outbreak, the risk of repeated
importation of SARS-CoV-2 into Singapore was deemed
to be considerable given that around 3∙4 million people
travel from Wuhan to Singapore annually.27 Furthermore,
the start of the epidemic coincided with the 2020 Chinese
Lunar New Year holiday, with the expectation that the
number of individuals arriving from China would be
similar to that for the 2018 celebrations (around
800 
000 tourists from China).27 The high influx of
incoming travellers exacerbated the risk of local disease
establishment, bringing at least 18 initial confirmed
imported cases into Singapore before Feb 4, 2020, when
the first four local transmission cases were confirmed.11
These four cases had contact with at least two infected
tourists at a shop, who were identified through intensive
contact tracing efforts. Although travel is now reduced, at
least 175 subsequent locally-acquired infections have
been reported at the time of writing across a diverse
range of residential and commercial sites despite efforts
by the Singaporean Government to quarantine and
isolate infected individuals. On March 16, 2020, 11 of the
17 confirmed cases were imported with travel histories
including the UK, Indonesia, Portugal, Spain, the USA,
France, Germany, Switzerland, and Belgium.11 On
March 17, 2020, a further 17 of 23 cases were reported to
be imported.11 With the risk of disease establishment
remaining high from the continued importation of cases,
workplace distancing and school closure remain as
critical interventions that can avert a significant number
of cases.

We found that these two interventions, when used in
combination with quarantine, would be highly effective at
low infection rates (ie, R0 of 1·5), with median of
10 
000 cases (IQR 200–28 000) observed for school
closures and 4000 cases (200–23 
000) for workplace
distancing compared with 279 000 cases (245 000–320 000)
at the baseline. At the highest level of infectivity (R0=2·5),
substantial reductions were observed with a median of
466 
000 cases (IQR 175 
000–728 
000) observed when
school closure was used and 320 000 (116 000–558 000) for
workplace distancing compared with 1 
207 
000 cases
(1 164 000–1 249 000) at baseline. However, if the preventive
effect of these interventions reduces considerably due to
higher asymptomatic proportions, more pressure will be
placed on the quarantining and treatment of infected
individuals, which could become unfeasible when the
number of infected individuals exceeds the capacity of
health-care facilities.
Scale-up of ongoing surveillance programmes and
rigorous contract tracing12,28 are thus required to assist in
the maintenance of a low number of unidentified
infections at this time, with school closure and workplace
distancing being potentially effective strategies for
deployment nationwide should local transmission, with
multiple transmission events recorded between individuals
in the resident population, begin. Our simulation model,
which examined hypothetical infection spread with
100 unidentified Singaporean cases as a seed population,
showed that for the baseline scenario (ie, no control
interventions) by day 80, when R0 was 1·5, around
279 000 individuals would be infected, when R0 was 2·0,
around 727 000 individuals would be infected, and when R0
was 2·5, around 1 207 000 individuals would be infected.
In the event that suppression of transmission through
quarantine is unsuccessful and local transmission begins,
which has currently been observed in other countries on a
small scale,29,30 policy makers in Singapore should deploy
alternate measures, such as school closure and workplace
distancing, in a timely manner. School closure has been
used in the past in Singapore to limit the spread of
hand, foot, and mouth disease, and was associated with a
decrease of up to 53% in secondary cases,31 probably
because children generally have high contact rates with
their peers in the school environment. Given this historical
experience, a similar programme for COVID-19 could be
established reasonably quickly. However, at present, data
on the susceptibility of children to SARS-CoV-2 infection,
the number of infected children in Singapore, and the
probability of children becoming symptomatic are limited,
making school closure less desirable than workplace
distancing.
The continually high percentage contribution of workrelated infections despite work distancing being effective
suggests that the workplace is a key infection site in
Singapore, whereby reductions in workplace trans­
mission averts cases at all other sites. The effects of
school closure and quarantine were comparable, since

the displacement of students to the home community
will then rely on quarantine as a measure of preventing
infection. However, asymptomatic cases, assumed to
account for 7∙5% of the infected population, would con­
tinue to contribute to transmission, and the identification
of these individuals presents a challenge.
Increasing the asymptomatic proportion in our model
from 7·5% to 22·7%, which is reflective of influenza A
H1N1,24 resulted in limited infection control with
considerable stochasticity, whereby the failure of early
quarantine led to outbreaks similar in size to those
observed for the baseline scenario, even when R0 was
1·5. Under this assumption, the median number of
cases averted compared with baseline ranged from
219 
000 to 282 
000 cases (64·4–82·9% reduction)
depending on the intervention scenario. For the
quarantine, school-closure, work-dis­
tancing, and
combined intervention scenarios, assuming an
asymptomatic proportion of 7·5% and an R0 of 1·5, a
median of 264 000–277 200 cases (94·6–99·4% reduction)
would be averted compared with the baseline scenario.
Thus, considering the differences in number of cases
averted by proportion of asymptomatic individuals in
the population, additional interventions, such as
vaccination (where research is rapidly ongoing) or the
prescribing of existing antiviral drugs that are effective
for the treatment of related viral infections, should be
considered. Contact inhibition remains important,
but the high proportion of asymptomatic and undo­
cumented infections and missed opportunities to
quarantine will make control challenging. Even at a low
infectivity (R0 ≤1·5), a high asymptomatic pro­portion is
problematic, with 58 000 infections (IQR 5400–123 000)
occurring at an asymptomatic proportion of 22·7%
compared with 1800 infections (200–23 000) at a 7·5%
asymptomatic proportion with the combined interv­
ention’. These effects were exacerbated further at
higher asymptomatic proportions of 30·0–50·0%. With
fewer cases averted and larger outbreak sizes from
undocumented spread due to asymptomatic individuals,
the dialogue partly shifts from containment to case
management to reduce mortality from complications.
Regardless of the proportion of individuals in the
population with asymptomatic infection, all the proposed
interventions should be used in addition to other
measures, such as rapid diagnosis and appropriate case
management, if local containment fails. Current
government-led outbreak control measures will only be
successful with public cooperation through exercising
good hygiene, infection prevention in shared spaces, and
adequate education to understand when symptoms
might be indicative of a potential SARS-CoV-2 infection.
Public complicity is particularly crucial for older
individuals (>60 years), individuals who are immuno­
compromised, and people with comorbidities who are at
high risk of severe complications.5 During the 2003
SARS outbreak, 238 probable SARS cases were reported

and 33 individuals died in Singapore, with the highest
proportion of deaths (45%) reported among people aged
65 years and older.32 The same observation is thus
expected for COVID-19 should local transmission occur
since the median age of infection in our models was
37 years (IQR 26–49), with comparatively few children
becoming infected because of school closure and aware­
ness among parents to quarantine children with fever.
Singapore has one of the highest employment rates
among older individuals (aged ≥65 years) of all countries
within the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and
Development (OECD)33 and a culture of eating at socalled hawker centres (ie, food courts), with around
75% of people visiting a hawker centre at least once a
week.34 Consequently, many older people are expected to
be exposed to infection at work or within their home
communities, which could be mitigated in part by
implementation of workplace distancing and, if possible,
incentivisation to remain at home and practise workplace
distancing, specifically for older individuals.
At present, the quarantining of family and close contacts
of confirmed cases is crucial, as shown by the substantial
increase in infection rates among individuals who shared
living spaces and bathrooms during the 2009 H1N1
influenza pandemic in China, despite the regular
disinfection of these areas.35 The protocols in place at
present, including the use of specialist ambulances,
negative pressure isolation rooms, and ultraviolet
disinfection, will assist in isolating the infection and
preventing transmission events at health-care facilities, as
was seen during the 2003 SARS outbreak.21 Since at least
15 medical staff in Wuhan have contracted the virus,3
Singapore has provided full personal protective equipment
for health-care workers; however, the results of our study
suggest that community transmission will substantially
contribute to transmission should local containment fail
despite these measures. The main control measures at
this time are surveillance, standard testing procedures,36
and quarantine of individuals who are confirmed positive
for the virus. Such measures have been used in the past
for suspected cases of MERS-CoV, which has a 34∙4% casefatality rate,37 with no cases of MERS-CoV reported in
Singapore to date, and for Zika virus, which established
locally in 2016, with only ten cases reported in 2019.38 Such
successes in preventing local outbreaks are attributed to
robust disease surveillance in Singapore. Nevertheless,
dengue outbreaks are ongoing in Singapore,39 which
highlights the difficulties in disease control that are in part
due to undocumented spread and individuals who are
asymptomatic; these issues are likely to affect the control
of the ongoing COVID-19 epidemic since many imported
cases worldwide have been asymptomatic on entry to
countries.9 The implementation of school closure and
workplace distancing can therefore be considered as a
potential secondary control response in the event of
infection quarantine failure and the establishment of
community transmission.

Our study has several limitations. First, since
GeoDEMOS-R is validated against census data, errors
exist in our estimations of population features that are
based on data that have been sample enumerated.
Second, a large population of migrant workers who
travel from Malaysia to Singapore each day, visiting
tourists, and long-term visa owners were not accounted
for in our infection dynamics. Third, the epidemiological
characteristics of COVID-19 remain uncertain in terms
of the transmission and infectivity profile of the virus;
therefore, estimates of the time between symptom onset
and admission to hospital, how infectious an individual
is over time, and the asymptomatic rate were based on
SARS-CoV. Once this information becomes available for
COVID-19, a full sensitivity analysis should be done.
Fourth, the contact patterns between individuals are
highly dynamic and heterogeneous across the popu­
lation; therefore, our simulated work, school, and home
popu­lations serve as a general estimation of infection
spread. Fifth, effectiveness of the interventions might
vary depending on the ongoing seeding of imported
cases, which we did not account for, and will also rely on
intervention compliance. Sixth, multiple indirect effects
from the interventions and modifications to human
behaviour are likely, which are difficult to quantify and
measure. The optimum times to implement each
intervention and how long they should be run for to
achieve long-term epidemic control should be explored.
Finally, there are multiple unforeseen factors that
remain challenging to assess at this time, such as
increased infection rates at mass gatherings, delays in
quarantining as a result of individuals not seeking health
care at symptom onset, alternate contact events in
locations such as public transport, potential transmission
events in the health-care setting, and the effects of
community-wide behavioural shifts in response to
knowledge of the outbreak.
Pandemic planning is crucial at the early stages to avert a
nationwide outbreak. In this study, we investigated the use
of interventions that aim to restrict contact between
individuals at important mixing sites: schools, workplaces,
and at home. We found that, especially for lower infection
scenarios (R0 of 1·5), a combined approach comprising
quarantine (for infected individuals and their families),
school closure, and workplace distancing is effective and
could prevent 99·3% of infections (IQR 92∙6–99∙9) when
compared with the baseline scenario. At higher infectivity
scenarios, outbreak prevention becomes considerably
more challenging because although effective, transmission
events still occur: for the combined approach scenario, a
median of 50 000 cases were estimated at R0 of 2·0 and
258 000 cases at R0 of 2·5. These combined interventions
should therefore be implemented rapidly upon
confirmation of second-generation local transmission
occurring within the resident population to suppress
increases in the national R0. At higher asymptomatic rates,
public education and case management become
10	

increasingly important, with a need to develop vaccines
and existing drug therapies.
