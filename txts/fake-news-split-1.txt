I got the following message from a friend.
Transfer. My classmate's uncle and nephew, graduated
with a master's degree, and work in Shenzhen Hospital.
He is being transferred to study Wuhan pneumonia virus.
He just called me and told me to tell m ny friends: If you
have a runny nose and sputum when you have a cold, you
cannot be a new type of coronavirus pneumonia, because
coronavirus pneumonia is a dry cough without a runny nose.
This is the simplest way to identify.
Please tell your friends that if you know more about
medical knowledge, you will have more awareness of
identification and prevention.
Director Zhenxing informed that the Wuhan vinus is not
heat-resistant and will be killed in a temperature of 26-27
degrees. So drink plenty of hot water. Can tell relatives
and friends to drink hot water for prevention.
From a Chinese doctor. To prevent Wuhan virus, as long as
the human body maintains heat energy, eat more ginger
and exercise more, you will not be infected with the virus.
If you have a high fever, cover yourself with a quilt Drink
ginger soup to increase the body's heat energy. It can prevent
infection. No vaccination required. Eat more ginger, garlic,
hot chilies, and pepper. Eat less sweet and sour and bitter.
Don't drink too much ice water. Don't go to cold weather
areas.
When the sun is in the virus endemic area, the virus will
completely disappear.
Everyone can share and help one by one.
Dr. Khin Maung U.
