ABSTRACT
Background: The Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) epidemic broke out in Wuhan,
China, and it spread rapidly. Since January 23, 2020, China has launched a series of unusual
and strict measures, including the lockdown of Wuhan city to contain this highly contagious
disease. We collected the epidemiological data to analyze the trend of this epidemic in China.
Methods: We closely tracked the Chinese and global official websites to collect the
epidemiological information about COVID-19. The number of total and daily new confirmed
cases of COVID-19 in China was presented to illustrate the trend of this epidemic.
Results: On January 23, 2020, 835 confirmed COVID-19 cases were reported in China. On
February 6, 2020, there were 31211 cases. By February 20, 2020, the number reached as high
as 75,993. Most cases were distributed in and around Wuhan, Hubei province. Since January
23, 2020, the number of daily new cases in China except Hubei province reached a peak of
890 on the eleventh day and then it declined to a low level of 34 within two full-length
incubation periods (28 days), and the number of daily new cases in Hubei also started to
decrease on the twelfth day, from 3156 on February 4, 2020 to 955 on February 15, 2020.
Conclusion: The COVID-19 epidemic has been primarily contained in China. The battle
against this epidemic in China has provided valuable experiences for the rest of the world.
Strict measures need to be taken as earlier as possible to prevent its spread.

INTRODUCTION
Emerging infectious diseases are great threats to public health worldwide. Towards the end of
the year 2019, an outbreak of a novel coronavirus (Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome
Coronavirus 2, SARS-CoV-2)(1-3) infection occurred in Wuhan, Hubei Province, China. It
rapidly spread to every corner of China and many other places around the world. SARS-CoV2 is a new member of the coronavirus family, which is different to Severe Acute Respiratory
Syndrome Coronavirus, SARS-CoV.(4) Current reports show that SARS-CoV-2 is more
contagious than SARS-CoV. The new coronavirus pneumonia has been named as
Coronavirus Disease 2019 (COVID-19) by the World Health Organization.(5)
On February 20, 2020, the total number of confirmed COVID-19 cases had reached as high
as 75,993 in China. Among these cases, 2239 died, and most of the deaths occurred in elderly
patients with certain underlying illnesses.(6-8) To confront this terrible epidemic, China took
restrictive measures to prevent the spread of SARS-CoV-2. Restricting the population
movement, shutting down of schools and factories, building up new shelter hospitals, and
many other measures were carried out. In addition to ordinary measures, the lockdown of
Wuhan since January 23, 2020, a city with more than 10 million people, was a unique and
unusual method. At the same time, many provinces and cities in China initiated a level I
public health event response. To further control the epidemic, from February 5th, 2020, all
confirmed and suspected COVID-19 patients and close contacts in Wuhan were asked to
quarantine at assembly sites instead of home quarantine. What is the effect of these countermeasures for controlling this epidemic?
The National Health Commission of the People’s Republic of China (NHC) and The Center
for Disease Control and Prevention of China (CDC) have publicly shared detailed
epidemiological information about COVID-19 every day since January 20, 2020.(7, 8) Based
on the information and published studies about COVID-19, many scholars have expressed
different opinions on the effect of these measures and the trend of this epidemic. Michael
Levitt, a professor of Stanford University, speculated that since January 25, 2020, the
national death toll and the death toll in Hubei province showed a monotonous declining trend.
The external linear correlation suggests that the number of new deaths in the coming week
will decline rapidly, leading to the conclusion that the epidemic would terminate soon.(9)
However, there are many other different opinions. The University of Lancaster, the
University of Florida, and the Centre for Viral Research at the University of Glasgow carried
out modeling analysis based on the data before January 21, 2020. They estimated that the
number of infected individuals may be as high as 14464 cases on January 22, 2020 in Wuhan.
If there were no effective measures, the total number of infection cases would reach as high
as 105077 on January 29, 2020.(10) A team of researchers from Xi'an Jiaotong University in
China and York University in Canada worked together to build a more realistic SusceptibleExposed-Infectious-Recovered (SEIR) model, and the novel coronavirus infection could
reach an inflection point on March 10, 2020.(11)

Big gaps existed between different predictions. Which one is identical with the actual
situation? In addition, being the eye of the storm, Wuhan city and Hubei Province show a
different situation compared to that in the other provinces in China. Therefore, we compared
the data of different places to predict the trend of this epidemic in China.
METHODS
Sources of data and searches
According to the study of early epidemiology of COVID-19 transmission, the incubation
period of COVID-19 extends from 1 to 14 days.(12) Therefore, we collected data of 28 days
(two full-length incubation periods) to analyze the trend of COVID-19 in China. We closely
tracked the relevant resources including Chinese and global official websites and
announcements between January 23, 2020 and February 20, 2020. China's data are based on
the everyday briefing by the NHC(7) and CDC(8). The relevant data included the provincial
distribution of the epidemic on each day from January 23, 2020 to February 20, 2020.
Case Definitions
According to the diagnostic and treatment protocol for COVID-19 (Trial version 5 revision)
released by the NHC(13), confirmed cases were patients with laboratory-confirmed SARSCoV-2 by real-time RT-PCR or next-generation sequencing. Comprehensive analysis of the
epidemiological history, clinical manifestations, and evidence of virus nucleic acid was
required. Clinically diagnosed cases were patients with a definite epidemiological history and
typical clinical manifestations.
Statistical analysis
Retrieved data were recorded in Microsoft Excel for Windows (version 18.19) for analysis.
Continuous variables included the total number of confirmed cases daily, the number of
newly confirmed cases, the number of deaths, and the number of severe and critical cases.
Graph pad version 8.0.1 (GraphPad Software, America), Tableau version 2019.4.3 (Tableau
Software, America), and Xmind version 2.0.2 (Xmind Ltd, China) were used for cartography.
Data from 23 January 2020 to 20 February 2020 were utilized for China map drawing.
RESULTS
COVID-19 was distributed in every province of China. Most of the cases were distributed in
and around Wuhan city, China. As shown in Figure 1, the number of COVID-19 cases
increased rapidly. From January 23, 2020 to February 20, 2020, the total number of cases
increased from 835 to 75,993 in just 28 days. Most cases were found in the worst-hit areas of
Hubei province. In Hubei, more cases were identified between February 7, 2020 and
February 20, 2020. The epidemic spread rapidly from Hubei province to adjacent provinces
and the whole country. In other provinces except Hubei, most cases were identified between
January 24, 2020 and February 6, 2020.

Since January 23, 2020, Wuhan, the capital city of Hubei Province, was in lockdown. Many
other provinces responded to the public health incidents by adopting quarantine measures and
community-level monitoring to control the epidemic spread. Figure 2 shows the changes in
the cumulative number of confirmed cases and the daily number of new confirmed cases
since the lockdown of Wuhan, Hubei province, on January 23, 2020.
Figure 2A shows that the cumulative number of confirmed cases kept increasing. Most of the
cases were found in Hubei Province. Total number of confirmed cases outside Hubei
province in China was 12,905 on February 20, 2020. Total number of confirmed cases in
Hubei province was 38,839 on February 15, 2020. Figure 2B shows the daily change in the
number of new confirmed cases since January 23, 2020. The daily number of new confirmed
cases in most provinces of China showed a downward trend, including Hubei Province. The
number of increased cases in the other provinces in China was significantly lower than that in
Hubei province. The number of daily increased cases in the other provinces in China reached
a peak of 890 on February 3, 2020, and then it continued to decline to as low as 34 on
February 20, 2020. The number of daily increased cases in Hubei province began to decline
on February 4, 2020.
The number of daily new cases in the other provinces except Hubei in China is presented in
Figure 3. The number of daily new confirmed cases in 25 provinces shared almost the same
obvious trend, increasing before February 5, 2020 and then declining. These provincial units
are listed in the order of the total case numbers as follows: Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang,
Hunan, Anhui, Jiangxi, Shandong, Jiangsu, Chongqing, Sichuan, Heilongjiang, Beijing,
Shanghai, Hebei, Fujian, Guangxi, Shaanxi, Yunnan, Hainan, Guizhou, Shanxi, Tianjin,
Liaoning, Gansu, and Jilin.
After Hubei province, the four provinces with the highest number of COVID-19 cases in
China were Guangdong, Henan, Zhejiang, and Hunan province. Figure 4 shows the time
curves of the total confirmed cases and daily new cases in these four provinces. The overall
trend of the total number of confirmed cases and the number of daily new cases in the four
provinces showed almost the same trend. About 14 days (one incubation period) later, the
number of daily new cases began to decline. After 28 days (two incubation periods), the
number of daily new confirmed cases dropped to single digits.
DISCUSSION
The COVID-19 emergency response epidemiology team of CDC in China conducted an
epidemiological analysis on COVID-19 and pointed out that since the first case was admitted
to hospital in Wuhan in December, the outbreak had developed rapidly.(14) Based on the
current reports, although the mortality rate is lower than that of SARS and Middle East
Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), COVID-19 appears to be more infectious.(15-17) The above
studies suggest that stricter measures need to be taken to contain the COVID-19 epidemic.

Realizing this critical situation, China adopted an old fashioned approach but the response in
China changed over time to science and risk based approach, and China adopted a bold
approach. The specific event timeline is shown in Figure 5. The data in this paper were
released after the implementation of strict measures on January 23, 2020. The trends in these
figures suggested that the epidemic had been contained in the two incubation periods after the
emergency response was upgraded to the highest level and strictly implemented around
China.
The major prevention and control measures are shown in Figure 5; as the outbreak spread and
the death toll increased, the Chinese government and healthcare authorities implemented
unprecedented measures. Since January 23, 2020, Wuhan was in lockdown. All public
transportation was suspended, The whole city was quarantined and monitored.(18) Soon
after, these measures were extended to the remaining of Hubei Province and many other
provinces in China.
Since the lockdown of Wuhan city, the shift of population from Wuhan city and Hubei
province to the other parts of China ceased. The Chinese New Year holiday was
extended.(19) The Ministry of Education postponed the school opening.(20) Meanwhile, the
Ministry of Civil Affairs and the NHC further carried out community-level prevention in
urban and rural areas.(21-23)
Figure 5 also shows that since January 23, 2020, the peak of new confirmed cases daily
occurred from February 4 to February 7. The report of the WHO-China Joint Mission on
COVID-19 indicates that according to the date of onset, the confirmed cases peaked between
January 23 and January 27.(24) The peak of confirmed cases occurred 11 to 12 days later
than the peak of onset, which is almost the length of the incubation period.
Although the total number of cases in Hubei province is still rising, the trend has begun to
slow down, and the number of daily new cases in China has decreased significantly. Other
than Hubei, four provinces of Zhejiang, Guangdong, Henan, and Hunan had the highest
number of COVID-19 cases (Figure 4). In one infectious incubation period (14 days), the
number of daily new cases reached the peak, and it decreased continuously in the second
incubation period (14–28 days).
After the adoption of strict prevention and control measures on January 23, 2020, the daily
number of new confirmed cases decreased significantly in the two infectious incubation
periods (28 days). The epidemic reached its peak earlier in most provinces than that
suggested by many prediction models. This shows that China's aggressive approach has
changed the course of the epidemic.
On comparing Figure 2A with 2B, we found that the number of newly confirmed cases in
Hubei province decreased significantly since February 6, 2020. The increase in confirmed
cases also slowed down. Since the opening of a shelter hospital in Hubei province around
February 5th and strengthening of the community-level quarantine, the transmission from

person to person was further inhibited. After two incubation periods, the number of existing
confirmed cases began to decline.
In summary, COVID-19 is quite different from SARS. It is even more infectious and
destructive. There are still many uncertainties about the epidemic. After the adoption of
aggressive measures, China has contained the epidemic. However, the cost is huge. Millions
of healthcare workers and social workers have devoted themselves in the fight against this
epidemic. Some of them have even dedicated their lives. Currently, the number of COVID-19
cases is increasing in many other countries. The battle against COVID-19 in China has
provided many valuable experiences for the rest of the world.
