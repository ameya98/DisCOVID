Abstract
There is a worldwide concern about the new coronavirus 2019‐nCoV as a global
public health threat. In this article, we provide a preliminary evolutionary and molecular epidemiological analysis of this new virus. A phylogenetic tree has been built

constrained Bayesian approximation analysis shows that the nucleocapsid and the
spike glycoprotein have some sites under positive pressure, whereas homology
modeling revealed some molecular and structural differences between the viruses.
The phylogenetic tree showed that 2019‐nCoV significantly clustered with bat SARS‐
like coronavirus sequence isolated in 2015, whereas structural analysis revealed mutation in Spike Glycoprotein and nucleocapsid protein. From these results, the new
2019‐nCoV is distinct from SARS virus, probably trasmitted from bats after mutation

features can explain the 2019‐nCoV zoonotic transmission and its
initial lower severity than SARS epidemic. These results do not
