ined tissue samples that were not required for
the diagnostic studies to determine the extractable levels of validated tissue profibrotic markers and compared the levels in the two groups.
Fragments from five normal lungs were also
included in the study as a control. The  patients in the treated group and the untreated
group had a mean forced vital capacity that was
% of the predicted volume and a mean diffusing capacity for carbon monoxide that was %
of the predicted volume. (The clinical and demographic characteristics of the patients are provided in the Supplementary Appendix, available
with the full text of this letter at NEJM.org.)
Among the patients who received EGCG, tissue levels of extractable type I collagen, which
was probably either poorly cross-linked or new
collagen, were near the normal reference levels
and were significantly lower than the levels in
the untreated patients (P = .) (Fig. A and
B). Likewise, in the treated patients, tissue levels of snail family transcriptional repressor 
(SNAI) and phosphorylated SMAD were also
significantly lower than those in the control
cohort. There was no evidence of a betweengroup difference in levels of total SMAD or
alpha smooth-muscle actin (α-SMA) among the
various groups. The empirical correlation between the degree of reduction in collagen I protein and phosphorylated SMAD levels was
positive, which was consistent with collagen
expression driven by TGFβ signaling (Fig. C).
We observed no evidence of correlation with collagen messenger RNAs (see the Supplementary
Appendix), which suggests that the inhibition of
LOXL collagen cross-linking may substantially
contribute to reduced accumulation of collagen I.
Serum biomarkers indicative of progression
of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF) do not
decrease in response to drugs that have been
approved for use in such patients by the Food
and Drug Administration., Surprisingly, during
 days of EGCG treatment, we found decreased

of

m e dic i n e

amounts of two fibroblast-derived serum biomarkers, cartilage oligomeric matrix protein
and periostin, which have been associated with
IPF activity and prognosis, a finding that is
consistent with an antifibrotic effect (Fig. D
and E). Our data suggest that in patients with
interstitial lung disease, EGCG treatment was
associated with a reduction in fibrogenesis and
thus may provide equipoise for the performance of a long-term, randomized clinical
trial of ECGC involving patients with this condition.

 work in Wuhan, so the risk of imported
SARS-CoV- infection to Taiwan from China is
high. As of January , there were  confirmed
imported cases of infection with SARS-CoV- to
Taiwan. We identified a case of locally transmitted infection in Taiwan from a wife to her husband.
On January , , a -year-old woman
with a history of type  diabetes presented with
fever to an emergency department in central
Taiwan. She was admitted to the hospital because of suspicion of pneumonia associated with
SARS-CoV- infection. She had lived in Wuhan
from October , , to January , . She
returned to Taiwan from Wuhan on January 
on an airplane. On the same day, a throat swab
was obtained from another passenger on that
flight; that passenger was confirmed to have the
first known imported case of SARS-CoV- infection in Taiwan when the swab was found to be
positive for the virus on January .
Fever and myalgia developed in the woman
on January , a total of  days after she returned to Taiwan from Wuhan. She reported
that she did not have cough, dyspnea, chest
pain, or diarrhea. Chest radiography showed diffuse infiltrates in the bilateral lower lungs (Fig.
A). Assays to detect influenza viruses and a
respiratory panel to detect adenovirus, human
rhinovirus, parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Bordetella pertussis, Chlamydia pneumoniae, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were all negative. A throat swab was positive for SARS-CoV-
on real-time reverse-transcription–polymerasechain-reaction (RT-PCR) assays on January ,;
this was the fifth confirmed imported case of
Covid- (the illness caused by SARS-CoV- infection) in Taiwan.
On day  of hospitalization, the patient received supportive therapies, and oseltamivir and
levofloxacin were added as empirical therapy on
day  of hospitalization after SARS-CoV- was
detected on RT-PCR. Cough, rhinorrhea, and
sore throat developed on day , and chest radiography revealed progressive diffuse interstitial
opacities and consolidation in the bilateral parahilar areas and lower lung fields (Fig. B). She
continued to receive supportive therapy with
oseltamivir and levofloxacin, but she did not
receive oxygen therapy. As of February , she
remained hospitalized, but her vital signs were
stable and she was not receiving oxygen therapy.

to be occurring and that he had no known contacts with any person returning from such a re-

gion; this was confirmed by an investigation by
the government health care unit in Taiwan. On
January , he met his wife when she returned
to Taiwan. They shared a bedroom and meals
at home.
On January , the husband sought medical
treatment at the same time as his wife. He presented only with rhinorrhea; he did not have
fever, cough, dyspnea, chest pain, or diarrhea.
He was admitted to the hospital because of concern regarding Covid-, given his close contact
with his wife. A complete blood count and chest
radiography did not show any abnormalities. Assays for influenza viruses and a respiratory panel
were negative, but SARS-CoV- was detected on
RT-PCR on January .
The husband’s symptoms developed on the
same day as those of his wife, January . This
suggests transmission shortly after his wife returned to Taiwan. During the hospital stay, he
had rhinorrhea, and myalgia developed on January , but he did not have fever (see Fig. S in
the Supplementary Appendix, available with the
full text of this letter at NEJM.org). He received
supportive therapy without any antiviral agents
or antibiotics. As of February , he remained
hospitalized, but his vital signs were stable and
he was not receiving oxygen therapy.

Total Hip Arthroplasty or Hemiarthroplasty for Hip Fracture
To the Editor: In a multicenter, randomized,
controlled trial, the investigators who conducted
the Hip Fracture Evaluation with Alternatives of
Total Hip Arthroplasty versus Hemi-Arthroplasty
(HEALTH) trial (Dec.  issue) compared the results of total hip arthroplasty with hemiarthroplasty in elderly patients with displaced femoral
neck fractures. The results should be interpreted
with caution. First, patient outcomes were analyzed within  months after surgery. Considering that implant survivorship in hip arthroplasty
generally starts to diverge  years after surgery,
such a short-term follow-up does not allow for
appreciation of the ultimate outcomes of the procedures. It is not surprising that the authors observed such analogous postoperative outcomes in
this short-term postoperative period. Second, recent studies have highlighted a similar -month

cost with both procedures and have indicated an
increased risk of reoperation after the conversion
of hemiarthroplasty to total hip arthroplasty as
compared with primary total hip arthroplasty
and revision surgery. These findings beg the
question of which procedure is more clinically
and economically effective. In sum, further comparisons of long-term ultimate outcomes with
in-depth cost-effectiveness analyses are needed
to illustrate the best treatment choice for selected
patients with hip fracture.
