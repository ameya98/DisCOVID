Abstract
To help health workers and the public recognize and deal with the 2019 novel
coronavirus (2019‐nCoV) quickly, effectively, and calmly with an updated understanding. A comprehensive search from Chinese and worldwide official websites and
announcements was performed between 1 December 2019 and 9:30 AM 26 January
2020 (Beijing time). A latest summary of 2019‐nCoV and the current outbreak was
drawn. Up to 24 PM, 25 January 2020, a total of 1975 cases of 2019‐nCoV infection

latest mortality was approximately 2.84% with a total of 2684 cases still suspected.
The China National Health Commission reported the details of the first 17 deaths up
to 24 PM, 22 January 2020. The deaths included 13 males and 4 females. The median
(52.9%) were the most common first symptoms among those who died. The median
number of days from the occurence of the first symptom to death was 14.0 (range
6‐41) days, and it tended to be shorter among people aged 70 years or more (11.5
[range 6‐19] days) than those aged less than 70 years (20 [range 10‐41] days;
P = .033). The 2019‐nCoV infection is spreading and its incidence is increasing
nationwide. The first deaths occurred mostly in elderly people, among whom the
disease might progress faster. The public should still be cautious in dealing with the
virus and pay more attention to protecting the elderly people from the virus.

suggested bats10 or snakes11 to be the potential natural reservoir of
2019‐nCoV. However, based on the latest statement by WHO on 23
January 2020, the source of 2019‐nCoV is still unknown.12 The 2019‐
nCoV appears to cause symptoms similar to SARS based on clinical
data from the initial 41 cases13 and seems to be capable of spreading
from humans to humans and between cities,14 according to two latest
studies13,14 published in Lancet on 24 January 2020.
Although WHO suggested that the current event did not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC),
they also indicated that the situation was urgent and needed further
examination.12 At present, in context of a lack of definite and
effective treatment, the most direct and effective way is to take
protective measures, including improving personal hygiene, wearing a
medical mask, having enough rest, maintaining ventilation, and
avoiding crowd, to prevent the disease. Updating the understanding
of the disease caused by the 2019‐nCoV infection is currently
urgently needed. Thus, we conducted the current study with the aim
to help health workers and the public recognize and quickly,
effectively, and calmly deal with the disease.

2.1 | Data sources and searches
A comprehensive search of Chinese and worldwide official websites
and announcements1,5,15–24 was performed between 1 December
2019 and 9:30 AM, 26 January 2020 (Beijing time). The relevant data of
distribution of infection on each reported day including 31 December
2019,1 10 January 2020,15 20 January 2020,16 21 January 2020,17
22 January 2020,18,19 23 January 2020,20,21 24 January 2020,22,23 and
25 January 20205,24 were obtained.

2.2 | Statistical analysis
Retrieved data were recorded into Microsoft® Excel for Mac (version
16.30) and analyzed. Continuous variables, including age, days to
death, and so on, were expressed as median and range deviation. The
Mann‐Whitney U test was utilized to compare significant differences
among continuous data. The SPSS version 22.0 (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL)
was used for statistic analysis. P values less than .05 were considered
statiscally significant. The EDraw Max version 9.3(EDraw Max lnc,
Shenzhen, China) was used for cartography. Data from 20 January
2020,16 22 January 2020,18,19 and 25 January 20205,24 were utilized
drawing the Chinese map16,19,24 and world map5,16,18, respectively.
