Abstract
To help health workers and the public recognize and deal with the  novel
coronavirus (‐nCoV) quickly, effectively, and calmly with an updated understanding. A comprehensive search from Chinese and worldwide official websites and
announcements was performed between  December  and : AM  January
 (Beijing time). A latest summary of ‐nCoV and the current outbreak was
drawn. Up to  PM,  January , a total of  cases of ‐nCoV infection

suggested bats or snakes to be the potential natural reservoir of
‐nCoV. However, based on the latest statement by WHO on 
January , the source of ‐nCoV is still unknown. The ‐
nCoV appears to cause symptoms similar to SARS based on clinical
data from the initial  cases and seems to be capable of spreading
from humans to humans and between cities, according to two latest
studies, published in Lancet on  January .
Although WHO suggested that the current event did not constitute a Public Health Emergency of International Concern (PHEIC),
they also indicated that the situation was urgent and needed further
examination. At present, in context of a lack of definite and
effective treatment, the most direct and effective way is to take
protective measures, including improving personal hygiene, wearing a
medical mask, having enough rest, maintaining ventilation, and
avoiding crowd, to prevent the disease. Updating the understanding
of the disease caused by the ‐nCoV infection is currently
urgently needed. Thus, we conducted the current study with the aim
to help health workers and the public recognize and quickly,
effectively, and calmly deal with the disease.

. | Data sources and searches
A comprehensive search of Chinese and worldwide official websites
and announcements,,– was performed between  December
 and : AM,  January  (Beijing time). The relevant data of
distribution of infection on each reported day including  December
,  January ,  January ,  January ,

. | Statistical analysis
Retrieved data were recorded into Microsoft® Excel for Mac (version
.) and analyzed. Continuous variables, including age, days to
death, and so on, were expressed as median and range deviation. The
Mann‐Whitney U test was utilized to compare significant differences
among continuous data. The SPSS version . (SPSS Inc, Chicago, IL)
was used for statistic analysis. P values less than . were considered
statiscally significant. The EDraw Max version .(EDraw Max lnc,
Shenzhen, China) was used for cartography. Data from  January
