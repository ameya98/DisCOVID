Abstract
Coronaviruses (CoVs) are by far the largest group of known positive‐sense RNA
viruses having an extensive range of natural hosts. In the past few decades, newly
evolved Coronaviruses have posed a global threat to public health. The immune
response is essential to control and eliminate CoV infections, however, maladjusted
immune responses may result in immunopathology and impaired pulmonary gas
exchange. Gaining a deeper understanding of the interaction between Coronaviruses and the innate immune systems of the hosts may shed light on
the development and persistence of inflammation in the lungs and hopefully can
reduce the risk of lung inflammation caused by CoVs. In this review, we provide
an update on CoV infections and relevant diseases, particularly the host
defense against CoV‐induced inflammation of lung tissue, as well as the role of
the innate immune system in the pathogenesis and clinical treatment.

Although the pathologies of SARS and MERS are not yet fully understood, viral and host factors play a key role in SARS‐CoV and MERS‐
CoV infections. During virus infection, host factors trigger an immune
response against the virus. However, it should be noted that immunopathogenesis is associated with an immune response out of control, which may result in pulmonary tissue damage, functional
impairment, and reduced lung capacity. Chemotactic factors are essential to the immune responses against the virus infections, given their
regulatory effect on dilations and positions of leukocytes in the host
lungs. Therefore, spectral changes in chemotactic factors may lead to
severely maladjusted immune responses. Immune insufficiency or misdirection may increase viral replication and cause tissue damages. In
contrast, overactive immune responses may induce immunopathological
conditions. In this review article, we provide an analysis of the role of
cytokines secreted upon CoV infections and their potentially detrimental
contribution to the damages of the respiratory tract and other tissues.

F I G U R E 2 The innate immune response and adaptive immune responses of Coronaviruses (CoV) infection during an infection. A, CoV infects
macrophages, and then macrophages present CoV antigens to T cells. This process leads to T cell activation and differentiation, including the
production of cytokines associated with the different T cell subsets (ie, Th17), followed by a massive release of cytokines for immune response
amplification. The continued production of these mediators due to viral persistence has a negative effect on NK, and CD8 T cell activation. However,
CD8 T cells produce very effective mediators to clear CoV. B, Attachment of CoV to DPP4R on the host cell through S protein leads to the
appearance of genomic RNA in the cytoplasm. An immune response to dsRNA can be partially generated during CoV replication. TLR‐3 sensitized by
dsRNA and cascades of signaling pathways (IRFs and NF‐κB activation, respectively) are activated to produce type I IFNs and proinflammatory
cytokines. The production of type I IFNs is important to enhance the release of antiviral proteins for the protection of uninfected cells. Sometimes,
accessory proteins of CoV can interfere with TLR‐3 signaling and bind the dsRNA of CoV during replication to prevent TLR‐3 activation and evade the
immune response. TLR‐4 might recognize S protein and lead to the activation of proinflammatory cytokines through the MyD88‐dependent signaling
pathway. Virus‐cell interactions lead to the strong production of immune mediators. The secretion of large quantities of chemokines and cytokines
(IL‐1, IL‐6, IL‐8, IL‐21, TNF‐β, and MCP‐1) is promoted in infected cells in response to CoV infection. These chemokines and cytokines, in turn, recruit
lymphocytes and leukocytes to the site of infection. Red lines refer to inhibitory effects. Green lines refer to activating effects

repair, and triggers a prolonged adaptive immune response against
the viruses. In most cases, pulmonary and systemic inflammatory
responses associated with CoVs are triggered by the innate immune
system when it recognizes the viruses. Although a broadly protective,
universal vaccine is considered the ultimate protection against the
virus spread, vaccine development can be time‐consuming. To fulfill
the pressing need, we should propose effective therapeutic measures
using the accumulated knowledge of the innate immune response
system. Targeted immunotherapy is a good alternative to some antivirals that have narrow treatment windows and meet with drug
resistance easily. In 2003, glucocorticoid was widely used in SARS
treatment to control pulmonary infection by regulating inflammatory
responses. Except for viral pathogenicity, the inflammatory response
of the body also plays a crucial role in SARS‐induced lung injury
cases. Therefore, in CoV pneumonia cases, it is important to control
cytokine production and inflammatory response, given that they are
responsible for the accumulation of cells and fluids. This strategy is
challenging as we have not yet clearly identified any features in an
immune response that can be inhibited specifically without compromising the beneficial host defense.
However, accomplishing this is not impossible. Notable
achievements have been made in analyzing detrimental and protective mechanisms. For instance, completely blocking a proximal event
in the immune response (eg, activation of IFN response‐related PRRs)
seems unwise considering its general role in regulating the host defense. In contrast, more limited and specific effector arms, such as
controlled production of oxygen radicals, NET formation, IL‐1, IL‐4, IL
‐6, IL‐8, and IL‐21 production, are probably practicable targets. At
last, further research is needed to improve the understanding of the
temporal features of CoV‐induced inflammatory response in relation
to the timing of therapeutic interventions.
